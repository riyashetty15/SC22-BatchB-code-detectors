"The problem becomes apparent that this is a selfish process of thought; people aren't thinking of those they share the road with. Laws currently in place are not to punish people making poor choices, they are an attempt to keep people safe. ",Rebuttal

"While that is true, it is highly unlikely and implausible",Rebuttal
you could lose your good drivers discount. ,Rebuttal
"However, talking or texting on cell phones while driving simply don't mix and has become a huge issue in the past few years.
",Rebuttal
There is always a solution to everything like having a car holder and putting gps rather than calling someone. ,Rebuttal
"However, hands-free technology doesn't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and it may make it worse. Research show that using headphones can be as dangerous as holding a phone because conversations distract drivers from focusing on the road. ",Rebuttal
"In today's society we've all become attached to our cell phones. it does not matter how good you are at multitasking, it should be banned and against the law. ",Rebuttal
but that's sill dangerous because you shouldn't take your eyes off the road anytime the vehicle is in motion.,Rebuttal
but they can be avoided taking precautions like insurance and driving safe and keep your car maintenance high or good,Rebuttal
"Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving. ",Rebuttal

technology has advanced that we can have our eyes on the road while communicating with others. ,Rebuttal
"But if a driver uses these ideas and guideline while driving, phones would not be a controversial topic that it is now. ",Rebuttal
 Other than that Devices in a hand of a driver should be prohibited and forced to drive safely to their desired destination harm free. ,Rebuttal
"However, I feel everyone has the responsibility to put the phone down and keep your eyes on the road and drive safely.",Rebuttal
"you should still need to think about others and your surroundings and not just yourself.
",Rebuttal
" In contrast, drivers who allow themselves to get distracted by their cell phones increase their chances of getting into an accident, as well as putting themselves and many others life's at risk. ",Rebuttal
"A cell phone can be a great tool, but it can also be a deadly one. Cell phone use should only be conducted hands free while a person is operating a vehicle in order to cut down on the distraction it can cause. ",Rebuttal
"but that is something that can be used before you start your car, and it can be put on speaker so you can hear the directions.",Rebuttal
"You can just as quickly stop on the side of the road to not only be safer while checking the emergency, but also giving your full attention to the matter rather than half and half.",Rebuttal

"Myself a guilty procrastinator (this is why I am making up this class) understand this argument but just be late for work or school and do it at home. Think about it what's worse killing someone by not paying attention or being late for work/school.
",Rebuttal
"A solution to this issue would be to require all drivers to use the ""hands free"" mode while using navigation systems.
",Rebuttal
"A solution to this problem would be that the driver can only listen to music while driving and only the passengers can watch movies while the driver is driving, which are all ""hands free"" solutions. ",Rebuttal
but even then the phone would be a distraction ,Rebuttal
"but people need to understand that earphones exist now that help you answer your phone that having it in your hand and of course texting can always wait, if its so important why not pull over instead or just a simple phone call.",Rebuttal
"Both sides have valid arguments that have increased major phone carriers and company's like Apple Inc. have creating phone features such as voice activated Hands-free Calling, Do Not Disturb, and Disable While Driving to help minimize the possibility of anything cell-phone related occurring, ",Rebuttal
" But , in reality its not . For example, you are driving and texting on your phone you soon look up and boom you crash . As you crash you hurt yourself the people in the car and the people out the car . To prevent this do not text and drive . ",Rebuttal
but in the real life it is. ,Rebuttal
"Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.
",Rebuttal
Even though you can do all of this stuff now you still need to watch where you're going and the speed limit so you don't risk other people's lives because of how fast your driving,Rebuttal
"but any technology, if used wrong, can be deadly to not only ourselves, but lives around us.",Rebuttal
"but again, if the driver is not misusing cellphones, it is essentially getting the same job done. ",Rebuttal
in my opinion there is no way that it can be safe. ,Rebuttal
Texting and driving could either be paid with your life or a ticket.,Rebuttal
It still is not safe but it is not as bad as using your actual phone.,Rebuttal
 Didn't you just call your friend to let them know you are on the way before you left the house? I feel that laws are made for a reason and they should not be broken by anyone. If no one is following the law than why do we have a law? ,Rebuttal
This is even more dangerous because you can't hear your surroundings. ,Rebuttal
"but at the right time. There are multiple ways in which a driver can be distracted while driving. They include talking to passengers, lighting up a cigarette and smoking,eating and drinking, etc.",Rebuttal
and that's where advanced technology takes place. ,Rebuttal
" I any case, without hands gadgets don't wipe out the danger of causing an accident and even make it worse by recommending that the conduct is protected. ",Rebuttal
 Maps are confusing for some people.,Rebuttal
"This is where the campaign ""It can wait"" comes in and other programs to promote wireless usage (ex. Bluetooth). Thus, ceasing any hands-on phone activity while operating the vehicle. Bluetooth wireless makes things more convenient for vehicle users. Calls, music listening, and more can be accessed using Bluetooth. ",Rebuttal
 we must be able to articulate when and where to use them. ,Rebuttal
This is negligent of the fact that a quick glance at their phone could be all it takes to get into an accident.,Rebuttal
"The safest thing to do would be to utilize what most cars come with, the ability to call someone without using your phone directly. In that case, instead of being texted, you could call, or be called. If you're on a phone call, you can still keep your eyes on the road, and there's less of a danger.
",Rebuttal
" research provides contradictory results. A study on the cognitive effects of talking on cellphones concluded that while participants often crashed while chatting, drunk drivers had reduced likelihood of a crash (Lipovac et al. 136). ",Rebuttal
one cannot deny that it is a potential hazard.,Rebuttal
This shows that many people are ignorant to the impact they have on their selves and others when they use their phones while driving ,Rebuttal
Tax-paying civilians are suffering because authorities do not hold offenders accountable for dangerous driving habits ,Rebuttal
otherwise put phones down you are taking other people's life for an electronic the phone isn't going nowhere but your life can.,Rebuttal
" Is it worth it because bad things happen everyday even if we don't want them too. Also , you can pull a ride with anyone and if there on the phone and you feel unsafe let them know that but if your scared you risking everything cause you never know what's gonna happen",Rebuttal
 I believe you shouldn't be on it period! ,Rebuttal
"However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable,

"In 2017, there were 34,247 distracted driving accidents and 15,341 that were aged between 15 and 29 were involved in fatal crashes while driving with a cell phone in hand. Therefore, some people may believe that using a cell phone while driving isn't dangerous, but the facts say otherwise. ",Rebuttal
This can be dangerous because they are risking their lives just to make a living and they don't even realize it.,Rebuttal
there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving and that it can wait until they get home.,Rebuttal
"However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and scary situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. ",Rebuttal
here are some ways we can eliminate the use of cellphones while driving.,Rebuttal
having a set of eyes on the road is still better than none at all. ,Rebuttal
"Here's seven reasons to stop using your phone and driving it puts innocent lives at risk, it puts your life at risk, it is comparable to, if not worse than, driving under the influence ,you are more likely to crash, it's very easy to simply pull over, you are setting a bad example for children and it is often illegal.",Rebuttal
but they are still human. The average reaction time to visual stimulus is 0.25 sec. Drivers spend so much more than that looking at their phones by the time they realize what's happening it will be too late.,Rebuttal
 however in GPS requires attention of the driver ,Rebuttal
That's not true at all because driving takes in a lot of focus and concentration in order to be a successful driver,Rebuttal
everyone is not capable of this,Rebuttal
"but numbers don't lie. According to the NHTSA, there was a Tesla fatality every 86 million miles in 2017, which is 40,000 deaths. Now imagine the amount of accidents in cars that don't drive themselves. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. ",Rebuttal
"However, with many perks comes many flaws ",Rebuttal
 but the impacts it can cause are huge.,Rebuttal
"If that is the case, then pull over to the side of the road, take the call, and then return to driving. If the call can wait, return it later. If it can't wait, you can always stop briefly. There should be no reason to pick up your phone while driving your car due to the hazard of the road you are putting your safety and other's safety at risk. ",Rebuttal
"Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.
",Rebuttal
"However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. ",Rebuttal
"Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones while they are driving.",Rebuttal
Though this is true people can multitask. ,Rebuttal
but some of them have admitted that they have been involved in an accident. ,Rebuttal
Using your phone while driving is a very dangerous thing to do because it can cause a lot of damage and can make some people pay lots of money.,Rebuttal
" However, there is no reliable scientific proof using your phone while being behind the wheel Makes you better at multitasking. There is scientific evidence that doing so does the exact opposite, which is why my claim that drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving. ",Rebuttal
"Therefor others of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. ",Rebuttal
"However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe.",Rebuttal
but in reality texting and driving is. Even though you're under the influence you still have an idea of your surroundings and have caution. When it comes to texting and driving you're not aware at all of whats going on around you or can see what can happen. ,Rebuttal
"This, however, is not true. Even though the driver is using the device for navigation, the probability of an accident occurring when distracted is still 400%. The GPS defense will also be used as a justification for operating a phone while operating a vehicle. Through the form of loopholes, drivers will use the GPS excuse against police officers to avoid the ticket.
",Rebuttal
While these can be positive usage of your phone it can still be very negative.,Rebuttal
majority admit to still doing it anyway. ,Rebuttal
"But that can also distract them from the road as well, they could be in a very important conversation that can cause them to lose focus of what they're doing and they could end up in a bad car wreck",Rebuttal
"If that is the case, pull over to the side of the road, take the call and then retire driving. If the call can wait, return it later. If it can't wait, you can always stop briefly. There should be no reason to pick up your phone while driving your car. ",Rebuttal
"However, work can be stressful and while driving possibly dangerous. Resulting from an upsetting conversation you may be distracted and may lower your driving ability.",Rebuttal
"However, once drivers feel like they have the go ahead to use their cellphone in any capacity, some may still try to go above and beyond to break the rules. Using a phone at any capacity poses a huge risk for all people on the road. ",Rebuttal
Many would say that this is a reasonable excuse but risking the life of an innocent drier is not acceptable. ,Rebuttal
" I would say that the solution to the problem in that case are to only take away the use of handheld devices and allow the use of artificial intelligence,such as siri and alexa,and wireless headsets.
",Rebuttal
 it hasn't it only makes people have the urge to reach for their devices even more. ,Rebuttal
but the proof is in the statistics.,Rebuttal
" Business people should still use caution while driving. It's still not safe to be using your technology while driving in your vehicle.
",Rebuttal
 So we should allow the ones that drive safely and follow the law to be able to use their cell phones but only to a certain extent.,Rebuttal
So I believe that we should allow the ones who follow the law to use their cellphone's to a certain extent ,Rebuttal
"There are many reasons as to why cell phones could be useful; however, they are greatly outnumbered by the cons.",Rebuttal
"If that is the case, then pull over to the side of the road,take the call can wait ,return it later. if it can't wait,you can always stop briefly. there should be no reason to pick up your phone while driving your car.
",Rebuttal
I don't think they should be touching a wheel because having that mentality could get someone killed because they want to drive reckless. ,Rebuttal
" The odds of an accident happening due to using your phone while driving are insanely high, majority of the people would consider minimizing those chances by simply not using phones while driving, for the SAKE of your life, and our lives!",Rebuttal
but this does not eliminate the consequences the phones causes.,Rebuttal
A little more in depth on why this is still a dangerous thing to do.,Rebuttal
but your phone still needs your attention to use the hands free law,Rebuttal
"and it very may well have been, but if it wasn't an emergency then there is no reason to be on their phone ",Rebuttal
" it is a more viable and safe practice to prohibit its use until a person it not behind the wheel of a vehicle. A person only puts themselves in more danger, even when doing something appropriate with a cellphone when operating a vehicle, by trying to utilize it and maintain focus on the road at the same time. ",Rebuttal
"However,

hands free does not eliminate the risk of causing an accident.",Rebuttal
But according to the data ages 30-39 year olds are the main source of the deaths and drivers ages 15 - 19 had the highest percentage of distracted drivers - 16% of those involved in accidents were distracted. The percentage of fatalities linked to distracted drivers increased from 10% in 2005 to 16% in 2009. ,Rebuttal
but it's not worth the lives of innocent people. ,Rebuttal
"You're not paying attention to one or two things simultaneously, but switching between them very rapidly""",Rebuttal
", no they can't that's why you should always focus on the road. ",Rebuttal
", and that's how consequences come in. That is why a lot of accident be occurring so much, you guys be hurt so bad. There is always for teens getting hurt and dying because they wanted to have they phone and be on it while driving. ",Rebuttal
"but we be in the wrong cause we be on them cellphones while trying to drive. There has been a lot of teens dying than adults ,because of these cellular devices.
",Rebuttal
but that doesn't change the fact that many of teens and adults are at risk when you're behind the wheel.,Rebuttal
The driver needs to focus on the road at all times to ensure that his/her passengers or even just him/herself arrives to their destination on time.,Rebuttal
 Just calling and driving should not be an offense. As people talk and drive with each other all the time. And being on the cell phone is essentially the same thing.,Rebuttal
you could have taken someone else's life.,Rebuttal
". On the other hand there are disadvantages of using cell phones, they can easily get lost. Talking on cell phones are very expensive. In addition, cell phones are not useful while driving, drivers should pay attention to the road instead of getting distracted from a text or phone call. ",Rebuttal
it is a start for correction. ,Rebuttal
"If you were thinking this, you would be right. This does indeed reduce the risks caused by holding the phone and doing everything ""hands-on."" But, you are still going to be taking attention away from the road and putting it towards the phone when you give a command or you make a phone call.",Rebuttal
"However, people still need to know where they are going. Being able to get where people need to go is better than being stranded or having to pay for ""Ubers"" or other forms of public transportation. ",Rebuttal
"Phones may be dangerous but they are a necessity, whether it is on the road or in a vehicle. ",Rebuttal
"people still overlook them, and continue to put themselves and others at risk of accidents. ",Rebuttal
studies have shown that even with a hands-free device it adds distraction to the driver.,Rebuttal
there are many ways to prevent an accident. ,Rebuttal
"even though those have been shown not to eliminate the risk of getting into an accident. ""Device makers and auto companies acknowledge the risks of multitasking behind the wheel, but they aggressively develop and market gadgets that cause distractions.

They acknowledge these things happen but they still market things that will cause distractions and increase accident risk.",Rebuttal
"Blasphemy, making it hands free or not it is still distracting the driver that few seconds it takes to either answer the phone or to look at your radio could ruin your life, in fact just play music on the radio and sing along I promise it'll make the car trip more bearable.   ",Rebuttal
"but even if that is the case those teens should not be able to drive because as stated so many times now, it is unsafe to text/ look at your phone while operating a vehicle because it is unsafe.",Rebuttal
"Furthermore, using your GPS while driving is still dangerous because you are taking your eyes off of the road, even if it is only for a few seconds, it is still dangerous even though your using your GPS to help you out to get to your destination. Ultimately, using your phone while operating a vehicle is dangerous even if you are using your GPS to your benefit to help you out, it is still dangerous. ",Rebuttal
"However, they can create dangerous situations like a collision or accident.",Rebuttal
"Although, hand-free devices don't eliminate accidents it worsen it by suggesting this gesture is safe.",Rebuttal
When you need your cell phone the most it's hard to find because they are stuck in the car ,Rebuttal
but can also be dangerous on the road. ,Rebuttal
"Instead vehicles were used to kill others, or make people suffer. Vehicles increased the use of cell phones at an alarming rate.",Rebuttal
Completely banning cell phones though? That seems to be a stretch. Personally speaking I've lived in Georgia for two years and I still need the GPS to get around. Who has the time or patience to carry a map of georgia and pull it up to read it at every stop sign?,Rebuttal
"They are far from right. It has resulted in many fatalities all across the nation and is illegal in some states. Using a cellular device while driving is not only a risk for your own well being, but those around you as well.
",Rebuttal
"Many people take advantage of those so called,""excuses"". If you need to use the phone that badly, pull over and make the call. Don't risk the lives of others to call your best friend and tell her about your day. Being a distracted driver isn't okay and it isn't cool. Using a cell phone while driving is illegal in the state of Georgia, yet people do it anyways.",Rebuttal
"However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident",Rebuttal
"However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe ",Rebuttal
but those are all false advertising because you do.,Rebuttal
but it doesn't mean that it hasn't happened to anyone else.,Rebuttal
but it also hurts use,Rebuttal
" However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and risky situation or an accident ",Rebuttal
Simply because someone feels like they must respond to a text immediately is why many of the accidents occur and most of the time this lead to a vehicular accident that can result in death. ,Rebuttal
"It seems like to you, that you aren't as distracted when driving, but in reality, you still are distracted even when just talking on the phone",Rebuttal
"However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe",Rebuttal
"However, it lacks safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car",Rebuttal
phone have also had it's disadvantage.,Rebuttal
"""Hands-Free"" texting and driving only solves a minor part of a major problem. Before ""Hands-Free '' texting and driving was more of a sharpened skill because of the task of averting your hand(s) and eyes to type a message all without running into oncoming traffic or running into anyone else. In short, ""hands-free"" isn't a safe alternative to texting and driving. ",Rebuttal
"this however comes at a great cost, and the risks associated with this behavior could be fatal according to experts at a local university in Kansas.
",Rebuttal
they are hazardous and in some cases deadly when a vehicle is involved.,Rebuttal
 but it can be a matter of seconds and you hit a car or if in a intersection you hit someone walking. Don't text and drive ,Rebuttal
They think that they are above the rules . It is unfortunate that these people still text and drive when the consequences are so high. ,Rebuttal
"With the use of bluetooth and similar advances, you can do many things on a cell phone without even touching the phone.

For example, I can use voice to text or voice dial options to communicate with others while I am driving.

This is a safer option that always allows me to have both hands on the wheel. ",Rebuttal
"I also think that having laws such as limited or zero tolerance of cell phone usage while driving can create an even bigger problem.

Before it was a law in GA, I feel that I was a safer driver, even when using my phone.
",Rebuttal
"Yes it is a distraction, but what about in an emergency when you need to speak to either a law enforcement agency, medical provider, fire department or even a family emergency. Paper maps can be confusing and now that phones have a gps, that makes going from A to B such a breeze. Meaning you would have to follow the directions of your phone either way.",Rebuttal
 but that's not a reason to have their phone in their hand. ,Rebuttal
"but if they are driving with their phone in their hand something bad will happen to them.
",Rebuttal
but it does need to be one. ,Rebuttal
"I get you need your phone for business, social media, long distance calling or texting but that can wait.",Rebuttal
"Cell phones are today not just the form of communication, but also a distraction and harmful component. ",Rebuttal
"yet it may make less control the vehicle and less power to focus which leads to very serious consequences. Regardless of what period this driver is or how skilled they are, under no condition should they be using their cellphone while taking. ",Rebuttal
but that one second could make the difference of life or death. ,Rebuttal
but they will give you a better chance to be a safer and more focused driver without having to take your eyes off the road,Rebuttal
So just wait for an appropriate time to use the cellular device.,Rebuttal
"As I said before I believe that people shouldn't use their phones while driving, but if you look at it from another person's point of view you start to wonder if like what if the person is a person who is sick and needs to be checked on every now and then, or someone who has to have assistance on something. ",Rebuttal
Both distracted drivers and road rage are common to each other.,Rebuttal
"However, texting while driving is just stupid. There have been several occasions where police have recovered cell phones after a car crash and the Snapchat application was open and the speed detector filter was active. ",Rebuttal
"However, there are proof to show that cell phone should not be use while operating a motor vehicle. ",Rebuttal
"Because of this selfishness, they put other people life's in danger.",Rebuttal
"however, there are alternatives to it.
",Rebuttal
"By making conversation, writing messages, or just playing with the mobile increases the chances of accidents.",Rebuttal
"Later in the article, it is mentioned that regulation on cell phone use is reasonable as long as it is enforcement properly. ",Rebuttal
"However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and it may even worsen the situation.",Rebuttal
"But that can cause serious safety risks if someone decides to check his or her text messages, emails, phone calls, or any other mobile applications while driving. ",Rebuttal
"However, not all are using them safely- having their phones in their lap, or next to them in a cupholder while looking at directions. ",Rebuttal
it is still considered dangerous and life-threatening. ,Rebuttal
but if you use the tools you can buy you can do it without having to look up.,Rebuttal
"but still at the same time, that's why you just turn your emergency lights on.",Rebuttal
"Learning how to text and drive is more dangerous than getting stuck at the top of a rollercoaster. Therefore, people should not text a drive ever.",Rebuttal
"I completely agree, if used incorrectly, cell phones can be detrimental to whoever is on the road with you, but one thing some of these advocates don't think about is the amount of people who are safer due to their phone ",Rebuttal
"While they do have more experience than new drivers, it does not mean they have mastered the task of driving while being distracted by their cell phone. This false idea many adults have leads to teenagers picking up on these habits",Rebuttal
" But even then I believe they shouldn't have their focus on it for more than a second. Calls should be made handsfree or bluetooth and directions should be entered before your departure ensues.
",Rebuttal
"Science begs a differ, during recent years it has been studied that texting while driving has become a huge epidemic. ",Rebuttal
 So there is no better decision than to simply postpone calls until you have arrived at your destination. ,Rebuttal
"but with the new technology, there are safer ways to answer the phone while driving ",Rebuttal
"Although that may be true, you are still more likely to use your phone regardless if its an emergency or not. States have been putting laws on phone uses which comes with fines. ",Rebuttal
If people don't give up cell- phones the number of people getting hurt on the road is going to increase drastically.,Rebuttal
"they probably have been living under a rock for the past couple of years because there has been this new feature that has been around for a couple years now it called ,hands-free feature.",Rebuttal
its also proven that using phones while driving driving may be beneficial. ,Rebuttal
" SOME* people though. I feel like that isn't bad at all, but texting while driving, looking down at your phone just aren't it. ",Rebuttal
"but, there is still a number of safety hazards to worry about when talking on the phone and driving.",Rebuttal
but the truth is those people truly can't. People claiming they can multitask or they know what they are doing are wrong and push a great risk. ,Rebuttal
"While this risk is undeniably present, restrictions on the use of phones is an action most states are implementing currently. The exact implementation differs from state to state, but most laws are ""Hands off"" laws, meaning that drivers can be pulled over and fined for driving for having one hand holding a phone.",Rebuttal
If the situation you are in isn't urgent then you shouldn't be driving and texting or on the phone checking social media or watching videos you need to watch the road.,Rebuttal
" but drivers shouldn't be checking their social media or texting while driving. This diverts their focus from what's happening on the road, leading to an accident. ",Rebuttal
"The constant use and over-reliance on phones have caused them to become very dependent on them. That means even while driving they are focusing on what's happening in the digital world on their phones, and not on the road they are driving on. ",Rebuttal
but the truth is that they are the ones that will probably cause that accident. ,Rebuttal
"however, this isn't the case. A poll done by the Huff Post revealed that 63% of drivers, aged between 18-29, text at red traffic lights. ",Rebuttal
"Another statistic showed that, ""More than 20 percent of distracted drivers age 15 to 19 involved in fatal crashes were distracted by cell phones...""(""Texting At A Red Light"", 4). ",Rebuttal
"They then have to learn the hard way, by wrecking.",Rebuttal
"That can only be helped by us humans putting down these devices while on the road, while there are laws in place, not everyone follows them, and officers can't always catch everyone.",Rebuttal
but it really is because it's dangerous. Some things that you think can't happen while your on your phone can happen to you or anyone.,Rebuttal
"but at the same time there is bluetooth and onstar for that reason exactly. It's not much you needing to be on the phone, you want to be on the phone, you're so use to it being in your hand that you constantly got to look down at it. ",Rebuttal
but any use of the device can cause a huge hazard to yourself and others ,Rebuttal
your reaction time is still slowed.,Rebuttal
but even for that split second something bad could happen.,Rebuttal
"If that is the case just pull over to the side of the road, take the call, then return to driving. If the call can wait, return it later. If it can't wait, you can always stop briefly. There should be no reason for you to pick up your phone while you're driving. ",Rebuttal
"but them mostly be the people that's being injured, most people lost their lives or end up being in car accidents because of driving while they were on their phone it's not safe and it will get you hurt . ",Rebuttal
"If it isn't one of those occasions, then you should not use your phone in a vehicle at all.
",Rebuttal
"However, this option is not completely hands free, as it requires the driver to either make an call or answer one.",Rebuttal
"Which could still be distracting to a driver trying to remember a phone number, rather than concentrating on the road. So no matter how your talking on the phone hands free or not it's never ok to be on your phone while driving.
",Rebuttal
"Well, you can awlays WALK to the public transportation area. Studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This leaves us wondering, ""Has Obama passed peak driving?"" ",Rebuttal
"This may be true, but if people use public transit then they are helping the environment even more than themselves. They would still have to walk to and from the bus stops. Which will decrease obesity although it may not be in as big of numbers as we would like.",Rebuttal
" but is better in the long run. You don't have traffic jams, you can go places and areas that cars couldn't fit through and you have many different ways of getting to a particular place rather than just a road ",Rebuttal
"But heres the thing, In section 3 Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus said ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" This means rain isn't a problem when walking on the streets ",Rebuttal
its good because they might think of building better cars like the hybrid so we wont have much pollution or wont have to use natural gas.,Rebuttal
if you carpool with people who are also going to the same place you save on gas money and you will also be helping the environment.,Rebuttal
but they still require lots of energy from the environment. ,Rebuttal
"but you don't neccesarily have to never drive a car again! What about on those long road trips, or when you have to carry a lot of passengers with you? A car would come in handy in such scenarios, but not neccesarily every scenario.",Rebuttal
though many areas are considering developments like this one so they can clean up the air. ,Rebuttal
 I do see this happening in small towns but cities would be more difficult to travel to unless they rebuilt everything within walking distance,Rebuttal
but having stress over the presence of traffic jams can over see any other kind of stress to be thought of. Heidren Walker and Andrew Selsky can both support that argument that having a car is a lead to stress that a reduction of cars can elimanate.,Rebuttal
"going without a car certainly has more pros than cons. There's less stress, it's cheaper, there's less traffic, it's healthier, and there's less pollution.",Rebuttal
but if you think about the cons ,Rebuttal
They say the rain hasn't stopped people from participating. ,Rebuttal
. But theres a down side if you go out to see what happend to you son in a hurry you probably going to have a car axcident and get seriously hurt or worst. Too many people use too many cars the streets are always crouded with cars at all times and some of these people drive crazy or they try to show of there car by going fast and end up getting killed or killing someone els. ,Rebuttal
"Benefically, ""stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.(Rosenthal 6)"". ",Rebuttal
 But the fact remains thats why the air is so polluted and why kids are so fat tyhese days. ,Rebuttal
"they could have gave people a warning and gave them a time line to find out how there were going to get around and make to far places they had to go. Not everyone has a bike, and alot of people have kids",Rebuttal
" it is better to go on a train, bike, skate, bus, taxi, carpool, or even walk because when you use a car too much you pollute the Earth",Rebuttal
but it has shown to be worth the extra time. ,Rebuttal
but this is for a greater good. So let's reduce our car usage and help our enviroment.            ,Rebuttal
" But there is evidence in the small town of Vauban, Germany; that life without cars is a very possible thing. ",Rebuttal
But people who stopped because of the recession may have no reason to restart that habit. ,Rebuttal
but thats exactly where public transportation comes in ,Rebuttal
"however, they don't think about how it can help the world around them. ",Rebuttal
 But there are many more cons that justify the right to limit car usage. ,Rebuttal
"However, when it comes to using a car limits to driving to a gas station 4 blocks away from where you live just for snacks, that's when things get out of hand. If you want to get somewhere, there are other ways besides cars that are safe and healthy for you. You could ride a bike, or even walk to where you want to go and still get the excersise you wouldn't get from using a car.",Rebuttal
But they are good sides of lowering car usage,Rebuttal
"David Goldberg, an offical of transportation for America said that in countries such as the U.S.A. 80% of appropriations have gone to highways. This ultimately sets the stone for the construstion of these lanes.",Rebuttal
"but nevertheless, with green house gases emitted from the tailpipes of cars ripping holes in the Earth's atmosphere, cars seem to be more of an impediment to the cause than an improvement. ",Rebuttal
well yeah you can do that but how will they learn for themselves? ,Rebuttal
but this will only cause the major destruction of our enviroment.,Rebuttal
" it can become a hastle when traffic comes into play. It also costs people lots of money when it comes to paying for gas, so an overall reduction of cars would fix all problems regarding stress.",Rebuttal
But even the idea of car-pooling can lessen the the use of cars. ,Rebuttal
"Although that may be reasonable, a testimomony from a businessman in Bogota explains that it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.
",Rebuttal
it does alot of harm to our planet as well. ,Rebuttal
" it stands that people are just happier this way. For example, Heidrum Walter is a media trainer and a mother of two says, ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" ",Rebuttal
 But it will save so many lives. ,Rebuttal
but although your body is comfortable are you really relaxed? i presume not! ,Rebuttal
 but if millions .. billions of people think the same way then thats billions of air polluting cars driving around the world polluting the air we breath to live! ,Rebuttal
" Cars are very handy i'll give it that,but sometimes they are unnecessary to use in certain situations. Peolpe like having a car for freedom and having their own transportation instead of relying on something else to get them around, but the thing is that we dont actually need cars that much for things.",Rebuttal
". But with that being said cars is not the only means of transportation, subways, railroads and buses are all possibilities too.  ",Rebuttal
"its also doing us a favor wether we like it or not, because constsntly breathing in polluated air is really bad for you it can have major affects on our lungs, and respotory system ",Rebuttal
"but on the other hand that community may be over populated or congested of cars. If this is so, then this will just have another negative impact of the environment. The purpose of the program is  to benefit the area you are and to lessen then the issue of car usages. All in all, the suburbs are taking action to create denser cities. ",Rebuttal
"We all own houses that cost so much! To be able to park your car you could have to buy a large enough garage, that would be at the end of your comuntiy that could cost up to $40,000. Why pay this outrageous amount to be the only one driving around your car-free city?",Rebuttal
This is a common question asked. We would be forced to put work establishments within walking distances.,Rebuttal
 but how will you be able to get to work faster if your job is many miles away? It surely will tire you out by then.,Rebuttal
"But I can certainly disagree and state that not only is transpotation through cars a great way to get around, but it's also entertaining.",Rebuttal
Lately people aren't feeling the whole waiting in traffic if theres an accident or just to much cars. ,Rebuttal
"but that will not happen since most people are not ready to make a commitment such as giving up your car. But if cars are not being purchased then they will stop being produced which can lead to a better economy since the government won't be spending billions on gas, diesel and such. ",Rebuttal
their are several other ways to get around without harming our enviornment. One option we should take into consideration is walking. A little excersise doesn't harm anyone so why is it that since we have cars no one really walks anymore. If the human population in 1812 walked so can we.,Rebuttal
but that isn't always a good thing ,Rebuttal
"if you take a car you are going to be mor at risk of an accident, you're going to be polluting the air, and you'll only be stressing yourself out in the process.",Rebuttal
but in between those two points theres alot of bad things that come with it ,Rebuttal
"but there are other means of transportaion including bikes, buses, subways and monorails. Think of the disadvantages to excessive car use, high pollution, expensive expenses such as gasoline and maintence of the car. Limited car use would remove all these burdens.    ",Rebuttal
"Riding a bike may take twenty minutes more, but think of all of the benefits in the long run.",Rebuttal
"There right, but it would be better for the world and ourself if we could reduce the usage of cars not just in our cities but all over the world.",Rebuttal
in the long run it benefits all of the community. ,Rebuttal
However the gas price keeps going up. All the money you spend on your car bill. Use it for taking you family to eat or the one year family trip.,Rebuttal
but then guess what then people will be late to jobs and will be cold in whinter then guess what you all state or country will go to compleate crap all because you want to be a healty apple in the world.,Rebuttal
 the effects of cutting down on car usage are mostly good ones. ,Rebuttal
"However, if the popularity increases, cities will be obligated to improve the conditions.",Rebuttal
 But it is time to break those running shoes out because our planet is dying.,Rebuttal
but i think they should only be used occasionally. Imagine if there was a car for everyone on the planet. Car usage should decrease.,Rebuttal
"Everyone would become much closer together and explore more of the world without cars. We could all be outdoors or around each other more. For example, you could take the bus to work instead of your car and meet a new friend. You never know what could happen when you try something new. It's good to change things up once in a while, like not taking your car every now and then and finding another way there.",Rebuttal
"But, Limiting or taking away cars would clear the air of smog and less people would have stress.",Rebuttal
"However,  there is still a noticeable decline in the use of cars in American lives. This isn't all bad though, some of Americas cities are falling into a danger that other cities across the globe have already fallen for; smog and greenhouse gas pollution. ",Rebuttal
There are many indrustries and or companys that have created electronic cars. Charging our cars many be difficlut for long road trips but there could be a slot for gas for when our battery level is running low we can get some gas to reach a destination and charge it. ,Rebuttal
"Cars are not neccisarily a need, they are a want",Rebuttal
But if i were you i wouldve choosen to walk because it very good for you because its like if you were doing exersice.,Rebuttal
"but you know its that big advantage about a car but the thing that sucks about a car you have to put gas in it, and thats oretty expensive for some people but thtas why some rich people are the only ones to be able to put gas in it. ",Rebuttal
"But, in every day life the car is a necessity.",Rebuttal
but the main thing they lack is practicality ,Rebuttal
" If being developed means being dependent on a harmful machine, then it could not be effective devlopment ",Rebuttal
"Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already renaming themselves ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range other than the personl vehicle. ",Rebuttal
some places have stores within walking distance so there would be no need for the use of a car. ,Rebuttal
"public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monay""(source 2). Also in Bogota, Colombia there is a program that ""[promotes] alternative transportationg and reduce smog"", a day without cars where ""cars [they are ban] with only buses and taxis permitted"" (source 3). The violators of this programed were charged a $25 fine.",Rebuttal
in general for the rest of the people this would be a good impact in their lives. ,Rebuttal
"Granted some of these ideas are still highly appealing to most places, places are staring to look more and more Vauban-like. ",Rebuttal
"Companies such as Ford and Mercedes are already starting to ""rebrand"" themselves as mobility companies and reorganising their product with wider varieties.",Rebuttal
 while on the other hand as a fact that decreasing car usage can only bring bennifits as the ones in the world shown today .This solution could be the start to a numerous amount of oppurtunities that can benifit not only in one way but manny.,Rebuttal
although worldwide limiting car usage up to now with these improvements has only bennefit for a better place to breath air that is growing to being less harmful and a cleaner enviorment to live by decreasing newborn bacterias that can harm us. improving global warming is something we all bennifit from either now or later. ,Rebuttal
"But on the better side of things, she can always take the bus or car-pool with her co-workers. Theres alway a better way to stop the pollution and save the ecosystem. ",Rebuttal
"The down information is that the government waste a lot of money on gas, and car prices, even on fast food resturants ",Rebuttal
but at the cost of our precious enviroment.,Rebuttal
But lets look on the positive side we do have ambulances and things of that sort so we really dont have that much to worry about.,Rebuttal
but we have made more advance cars that run on electricity and it takes where we need to go at the same place and doesnt do harm to the atmo sphere.,Rebuttal
"those are all true statements and that's fine it really is. Just limit it and things will start to get a lot better, trust me. It all starts with one person willing to make a change and that person can be you.                             ",Rebuttal
but maybe they just are not educated about these new ideas. ,Rebuttal
but the businessmen don't exactly just lay down and take it.,Rebuttal
 they can always just use public transportation. ,Rebuttal
"but a paying a 22-euro fine, which is 31 dollars in america, doesn't sound quite convinient.",Rebuttal
"Sadly, however, most are not built and designed that way.",Rebuttal
People of that age should feel the need to go out and get more excersise and look at the world from a different perspective than to look at the world from inside a moving vehical. In the artical it states from some people of the community they included that everything was much better not having a vehical to drive with she stated that it made her tense.,Rebuttal
in actuallity this would be a tremendous favor to all if they participated.,Rebuttal
"we always ahve to go through things that are hard to get us to soemthing better.
",Rebuttal
"In reality, that few extra minutes you have waiting for the taxi can be stopped you can do this by, calling the taxi a few minutes before you want to leave so that it will arrive precisely when you want it too. With the use of bikes, walking, or skating everywhere you go, you will also begin to get into better shape, as you are moving towards your destination. The usage of cars for only trips that will take hours will also help to save you money on gas, and your car millage. ",Rebuttal
" but there have been scenarios in which this has been a positive change in society. In Andrew Selsky's ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", a description of a city's participation in a car-free day is given, and Selsky also characterizes that other surrounding cities participated because it was such a successful idea. Carlos Arturo Plaza mentions that the car-free day is ""...a good oppurtunity to take away the stress and lower air pollution..."" (

Selsky

, Paragraph 24). ",Rebuttal
" However, the car has also caused lack of mobility, cutting back on people's exercise as they no longer have to walk very far to get from point A to point B, the overwhelming responsibility and cost of owning a car has also put a mental strain on people, causing needless stress.",Rebuttal
"alright, there are many more reasons why this is beneficail.",Rebuttal
but it doesn't. ,Rebuttal
but everyone loves their life also.,Rebuttal
Perhaps only time will tell if the culture of cars will end.    ,Rebuttal
"Other countrys including some parts of the United States have given up their cars and riding bikes instead,",Rebuttal
"It seems like a huge hit, which is good for the government promoting it, because if people had anything better to do, the idea wouldn't last a second.",Rebuttal
"This, without a doubt, is to combat the loss of sales and encourage people to continue buying their products. However, thos is pretty much all there is on the negative side of limited car usage. For the rest of the community, this doesn't affect them and is in fact quite benificial. ",Rebuttal
but I think the opposite is true ,Rebuttal
"That's fine. I'm not saying to wipe out the fact that you have a car, all I'm saying is to use it wisely. Drive long distances, not short ones that can take you ten minutes to walk.",Rebuttal
"Well, if we all followed what Bogota is doing and develop shopping districts and renewal companies, I'm sure there will be many jobs available. No matter the pay, you'll still have no worry about your automobile bills, which will help you save a huge amount of money. ",Rebuttal
but towns like this one have all the shopping and parks within walking distance of your home ,Rebuttal
a democratic poll can be issued to help even the playing field,Rebuttal
" However, it may be more fun than if teachers made the assignment, but it would be a waste of time and effort. ",Rebuttal
this should not be the case if schools wish for their students to learn to be responsible and independent.,Rebuttal
"They have not thought about, the students. Making it easier on themselves, doesn't make it better for their students. ",Rebuttal
they do not gain a much broader view on the topic of the project. ,Rebuttal
"teacher-designed projects would be more efficient regardless since it could be more helpful to teacher because it could be based on exactly what the teacher wants to know about what the student knows to help them succeed for the rest of the school year. And most summer assignments are different depending on the class too. If a student is going into a class they've never taken before, how could they make up a student-designed summer assignment to help them when their teacher could just give them a direct summer assignment as a jump start for the school year.",Rebuttal
"Which would not be the case at all. Many students would take their time in crafting a project that meets all standards and would probably write more than what is expected, due to the project peaking their interest. Teachers would in fact, see an increase of higher marks. However, if a teacher feels that the project is not up to standards they could always low score it and have the student try again. In allowing students to design their own project teachers will receive projects that exceed all requirements due to the students behind the projects being interested in what they were learning. ",Rebuttal
"Which is great in theory,but not in the long run. It does not benefit the student to have a guideline or rubric, it only benefits the teacher because the projects would be easier to grade.",Rebuttal
This could be avoided if teachers made guidelines for students to follow,Rebuttal
"But, not only would student made projects be beneficial to the children, it would also be beneficial to the teachers as well.",Rebuttal
" However, teachers could approve the designs to make sure they are educational.",Rebuttal
most would use their interest to create a project they would enjoy doing,Rebuttal
then the student might feel smothered or boxed in by how they feel about the whole project in general which would be doing the opposite of benefiting the student,Rebuttal
 teachers must think positively about every student's potential,Rebuttal
 But not every student has those responsibilities and the others who do should find a little bit of time for their projects.,Rebuttal
teachers design them to know more about each student and will be prepared to reevaluate their lesson plans. ,Rebuttal
"But honestly you'll thank them later on as you get older or when you have kids because, how society now days is set up is crazy! , i tell you. ",Rebuttal
"However, student designed projects are better for the class. The kids will be willing and able to do a project that him or her want and desire to do.",Rebuttal
"but they are wrong because what is important to learn in one field might not be as important to learn if they chose to pursue a job in another field.
",Rebuttal
student-designed projects are a lot more beneficial to every individual student ,Rebuttal
". However, trying to reform your students would only be in vain. How are students going to fully understand if teachers don't give them the space to be independent?",Rebuttal
"It might be a waste of time, however, your students will feel more engaged with the subject.",Rebuttal
but it is what's best for them and it will surely help them a lot more than the easy projects that they would have much rather chosen. ,Rebuttal
" the project not being interesting should not be the case because they are learning not playing around. In addition, the students should know that having ideas on an project can help more so confusing them.",Rebuttal
"however, they do not allow students to use their own liking and interests as freely when working with others. ",Rebuttal
a teacher-designed project would insure that the information being learned connects to what they need to know for school,Rebuttal
If the project is teacher designed then it gives no way for the students to express their creativity ,Rebuttal
but most students might just have an idea about what they need to know but might not know about the course in detail as much as the teacher does with all their years of experience and trying new approaches to figure out what works best for their students ,Rebuttal
while its true that some students may benefit from this there are still a lot of students who wont I believe that a student my first master the level that there at now in order to proceed into a higher level of education. ,Rebuttal
This is incorrect due to the fact that the students aren't familiar with the subject or what needs to be taught. The students also aren't responsible enough to decide what needs to be learned over their break. ,Rebuttal
" students just use what they already know. Teachers will make sure others learn because that's their job. They'll have students focus on the project, and not creating it.",Rebuttal
"Since the students are the ones designing it, it'll give them a little more excitement and control over the project.",Rebuttal
"students are over confident in their abilities on what the know and don't know. As a student in high school, I constantly believe that I am smarter than I truly am. Students will think they know more than they really do and will already be behind before the school year starts. ",Rebuttal
"However, giving students a easy way isn't always the best thing to do. Having students design a project has better outcomes in the long run. ",Rebuttal
"student-designed projects are overall superior because they give more freedom, creativity, and flexibility for the students during their summer break",Rebuttal
 but this is untrue. ,Rebuttal
"however, that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that every student is different and some students need more freedom in education.",Rebuttal
"However, by allowing summer projects to be student-designed, teachers do not have to come up with a topic themselves. Additionally, they are exposed to a wide variety of projects, allowing them to be more interested in the presented material. This allows teachers to be more likely to grade the projects fairly, as they do not have to repeatedly look at the same information. ",Rebuttal
" This project brings out the teachers true character as well, we can see if the teacher is really loving as people say they are no matter what, or will their true colors show? This whole thing is one big assessment on everyone's moral values. Are you a fan or a hater?",Rebuttal
"Although this could be case, summer projects are indeed just summer projects and should not be taken seriously. Summer should be the time where students can have the choice of doing what they want. If projects are mandatory for teachers, then it can be arranged, but it shouldn't put unnecessary stress on students. Especially during summer break. Teachers should observe how well the student comes up with ideas and how well they execute their projects, it's more exciting that way. ",Rebuttal
teachers understand the requirements students should meet in order to learn efficiently throughout the summer so that they will not forget important material.,Rebuttal
but consequently that is not the case.,Rebuttal
 but teachers insures that all the students have the needed work and information that the students need to learn. Also the teachers would have all the information if the student forgets to include in their project,Rebuttal
but they are wrong because the drive for success should come from the student not the teacher. ,Rebuttal
they are wrong because if a student truly care they will go above and beyond to see the it is completed full to the best of their ability. From start to finish.,Rebuttal
"However, letting the student have the option to choose their topic would not allow the student to not give effort or any creativeness. The topic would only be designed by the student and what their personal skill level is, leaving them to set their own boundaries up based on what they prefer. ",Rebuttal
"But, what if the teacher assigns the project about Mahatma Gandhi's struggles in his life? Students even if they lack interest in this topic, have to complete the project anyway. Lacking interests in a specific topic also lead students to a stage where they cannot contribute their 100% to their projects because this is what they don't have their interests in. Therefore, from their little amount of effort, they will not be able to obtain good amount of scores.",Rebuttal
Teachers can even give them a rubric with all the information the students need to use. ,Rebuttal
"Teachers at the end of the day are assigning the project, they can put guidelines and expectations on top of the students project design.
",Rebuttal
"some say doing a project with parents might help kids focus as well. No kid wants to mess around during a project with their parents.
",Rebuttal
Therefore I do think teachers should design a version of the project for students,Rebuttal
 I know that you'll have to worry about how the teachers want it done anyways but in this case the student will have the advantage of designing the project themselves rather than having the teacher design cause any confusion,Rebuttal
"this is not true. By allowing students to create their own work, teachers will find that the overal l quality of work, and happiness of the class will be raised.",Rebuttal
" But that is far from the truth. It is the opposite, students are more restricted when they are forced to create a project with a topic they are not the best at, which leads to the next point. ",Rebuttal
that is why teachers would assign these projects for the teacher to know the understandings of their students.,Rebuttal
"However, this point of view is wrong because the definition of an important topic is different to everyone.",Rebuttal
 it is more likely that they would do something easy they already know about. ,Rebuttal
"For the most part, if students are just given maybe one or two rules stating that it must be a project that someone can actually obtain information from and that the project is not just a simple little project. Then the need for a teacher to design a project for the students is effectively gone, since they would only have to follow the simple rule of not making it too easy on themselves and make a project that will help them excel academically.",Rebuttal
" they are able to realize what they can and can't do. Yes, continuing student's education over the summer might be the best for them, but is it really worth stressing them out? ",Rebuttal
"The counter to this is that when a student designs a project that they are interested in, the likelihood for that student to complete the project increases greatly. ",Rebuttal
but if students have assignments during their time off is that even summer break if students still have to do work during thier break.,Rebuttal
"However, the students should have some say in the amount of work they chose to do. Students should also be given multiple platforms to choose from, but not completely free range",Rebuttal
"However, many young people will actually take advantage of being able to design their own assignments.",Rebuttal
"While this can sometimes be beneficial, such open interpretation leads to less directed focus on the actual cirriculum, making the student-designed approach less effective than the teacher-designed counterpart. ",Rebuttal
"That is where you are wrong, you see, kids around my age such as thirteen to eighteen are known to be gargantuate procrastinaters.

We may want to do something over the summer and might find it cool but more than likely we won't end up doing it.

If the subject at hand is required then we would have the drive to actually do it rather than loiter, and since we crated it and find interest in it we would most likely do the project early on and efficiently. ",Rebuttal
 I disagree with that statement,Rebuttal
" Student designed projects are still the better option, when a student is creative it leads to an overall better project. They also have an easier time with the project, which leads to more motivation to do the project and get it over with. Also , actually enjoying the project leads to an overall better and less amount of work time.",Rebuttal
"understand that to a degree, but outside of doing projects that's how everything else is. Worksheets, quizzes, and tests are all rule driven. We don't get to choose how we want to do them, because they are already made a certain way. In my opinion, it doesn't leave much to the imagination which is one of the most important parts of doing a project. When we are put in a box it takes the enjoyment out of the project, and we don't try as hard. ",Rebuttal
they are all basing it off of statistics ,Rebuttal
"Although it is understandable to think this way, this reasoning is flawed because teacher-designed projects don't always connect with the students.",Rebuttal
However; without that direction students can have full creativity over what they do,Rebuttal
"but if the project is teacher-designed you will learn more. Student designed-projects will not test the brain as much as a project that they know nothing about will. Moreover, students will be put to the test more if they have to research something that is beyond logic. Even though you will learn more doing a teacher-designed project it still the easier option. For that reason, teacher-designed projects are the better fit because the whole point of making students do a summer break project is to ensure that they learn as much as possible.
",Rebuttal
"However, when you give students creative freedom, they are more likely to put in extra effort because they would enjoy their projects more.",Rebuttal
"On the other hand, if students were able to design their own projects, they would be able to choose a topic to research and write about that interests them ",Rebuttal
"However, if the project is required for school, that typically means it is graded. Students won't try to do the least amount work possible just to save them time, if that means they will earn a D on the project. They will start the year off poorly. The overall effect of the project will outweigh how much time and effort is put into it. ",Rebuttal
It is true that students are the ones that have to complete the projects but the teachers know what will be better for the students to help benefit them ,Rebuttal
the freedom received by creating one's own project could actually leave students disinterested with a topic mattter they know little about. ,Rebuttal
this unfairness is consistent with the method of which projects and tests are given out during the school year ,Rebuttal
 but too much freedom may lead to a lack of understanding and excerbate disinterest with the subject matter.,Rebuttal
"The problem about that is, the student can do the project the way the teacher does not want it to be made.",Rebuttal
However It will take you way longer to complete.,Rebuttal
"That worry is not necessarily true; even if the students' project does not have a real world application or a use as soon as they finish, the project still has value. Designing and completing these projects show students what it is like to go through this process from start to end. No matter what the outcome of the project is it still serves it's primary function; to keep kids learning over the summer. Some of the most famous science experiments don't work, these help future scientists decipher what will work.",Rebuttal
"However, if the teachers do decide to do this, the students will then not be able to understand what to do, they will not be able to do the project, and they can be very relectutant enough to do the project. Instead, what the schools' can do is let the projects be student-designed so, students will be able to choose a project that appeals to them and be able to continue learning about. From this, many students would work on their projects, be motivated and end up work as hard as they can to do well in their academics. This will soon give a bright future towards all the students and a time for all the teachers to relax.",Rebuttal
"While understandable if a project is designed by a student it does not mean the students themselves will be grading the project. Since students are designing their project, there is still a rubric to follow and a teacher to grade it, so students, fearing a terrible grade will give their full effort in achieving a high grade to start the year off.",Rebuttal
"teacher-designed projects aren't the better option. Even though every student has a project idea, not every student has the means of accomplishing them. Even if they were, there's no tell whether they will like doing it or not. Students that don't like the project are more reluctant to finish or even start. While teacher-designed projects have one advantage, they also have many disadvantages.",Rebuttal
"However, this is not true as someone's interest in something does not determine whether they will do it or not, but their work ethic is the true determining factor.",Rebuttal
but just because the project is student designed doesn't mean it couldn't be regulated or have certain requirements given to them by others. ,Rebuttal
students must acknowledge their deficiency in areas needed to provided a well suited project. ,Rebuttal
But knowing that i've already spent months in schools and i've picked up their traits along the way I am not trying to have to force myself to do anything in the time that I am free from school. ,Rebuttal
"but this is false. Although some may disagree, students should design their own projects over the summer.",Rebuttal
 but this is not true,Rebuttal
"but any subject can enhance the knowledge of a student. Even if the student is interested in video games, they could still complete a project on the mental effects of violent video games.",Rebuttal
"But, allowing students to design their own project would instead peak their interests, so they would feel encouraged to put effort into the project.
",Rebuttal
"Although this may be true, teacher-designed projects would be more beneficial than a student choosing their own subject.",Rebuttal
"Actually, a student-designed project is more difficult than it seems ",Rebuttal
"But this could be avoided by having students submit their topic online over the summer so teachers know what they can do to be prepared. Students can then meet with three or four teachers, one of which could be someone with some prior knowledge of the topic, and students can go more in depth into their project. Teachers can ask questions making it more like a discussion that the student can lead instead of a student presenting to a class of their peers. ",Rebuttal
" I would have given up and procrastinate whenever there is a project assign to me over break. If the student design the project it would not very educational, they would not know what to do on the project. Having a teacher-designed project is important to their education and to the school. Their lack of understanding of creating a summer project that has to be important to their electives and their learning.",Rebuttal
"but a student-designed project can outbalance the good in a teacher-designed project. Rather that telling us what we need to Know students should be able to show just how much they actually know, some student can look up the information then forget about it because it is something that they are being graded for and have to include it in the project to get the best grade they can achieve. ",Rebuttal
Although some students would just want to be done with their project and do something easy most students would want to use this project as an opportunity to get their point and ideas across ,Rebuttal
"But when taking a look at the students in these AP classes, on average students in AP classes struggle and receive poor grades in these classes. This is due to the lack of teacher leadership in these classes. Students in AP classes do not get enough guidance to fully understand the curriculum. ",Rebuttal
"however, if students make their own summer project design it is way better because student have better ideas, less stressful, and get to have more fun while doing the project.",Rebuttal
but having a rubric and due dates can also make students unable to build or practice that independent work ethic and will most likely end up relying on someone to do the responsibility.,Rebuttal
"Put yourself in a young students' shoes, you're in school for nine months and you finally can relax, go home, and just enjoy your time off because you did great during the school year and you deserve it. Then your teacher mentions summer assignment's that will be designed by him or her. The assignment's will likely be a load and it all has to be completed by a certain date. That's just completely unfair, because you work hard all year just to get time to relax and you can't. It's probably very overwhelming and young students need time to take a break and have fun especially after the long nine month slog they call school. ",Rebuttal
"but that's false.
",Rebuttal
" Even though teacher-designed projects are easier to grade for teachers, it limits the students' ability to push themselves to go farther and think independently ",Rebuttal
 but it will still be easier to grade the projects consistantly if it is all quality work that the student enjoyed completing.,Rebuttal
"However, the thought of limitation manifests into the actual limitation of the students and their lack of experience.",Rebuttal
"but students would rather create something to their own benefit. What I mean by this is, students will come up with a task that's easy enough to complete. Nothing challenging, time consuming, and well organized would be taken in to consideration. They don't want to create something that makes them have to think outside the box. They'd rather keep it simple.",Rebuttal
but students understand things more when it's coming from experience. ,Rebuttal
"Though, there are students who do not do the appropriate amount of work throughout the school year, many students already handle great responsibilities in their life; such as babysitting a younger sibling, sports practices, and having a job to not only support themselves, but their families too. ",Rebuttal
This is where the real beauty of student-designed work comes in. Even those who don't want to have to sacrifice their precious three months of freedom can still get in valuable time applying what they learned the previous school year.,Rebuttal
The students free choice would come out during the creation of the project meaning it could be perfect for them and then they work on it in their own way ,Rebuttal
" but various pscyhologists, notably Generic_Name, have disproved the claim, finding no evidence of maturity being linked to one's intuition or strive of creativity. In fact, this myth actually arose due to various reforms of the Progressive Era restricting children and immigrants' personal freedom, which continues to this day. Although many would deem this irrelevant, it is precisely the reason that we must not hold back to provide students with freedom in creating their own projects and avoid persisting a key issue. ",Rebuttal
" Research conducted by various universities, such as the University of Chicago, has shown that students are not prepared for upcoming projects every time they complete a teacher-designed project;",Rebuttal
 this is false because if you make the project you know all the steps and how to follow them. ,Rebuttal
this would just promote the ability to think for their own ,Rebuttal
"However, the point of someone expressing creativity, is being able to take anything and make it their own. A student can still be creative and express themselves through the work given by the teacher. Having the ability to express his or her own ideas and meet the requirements, will stand out to any teacher evaluating it. Just because the range of ideas and creativity is limited when the student is not able to create his or her own project, does not mean creativity or personal ideas are completely shut out and prevented from being intertwined within the teacher's design.",Rebuttal
"but what if you fail the project? What if you canÃÂ´t finish in time? Both of these could happen, then what will you do? ",Rebuttal
"However, role reversal and having the students design the projects can result in more creative ideas, have individuality or unique portrayals of each separate idea, and a overall better interest in the project itself. As a result this side is more effective because you can gain more interactions within the targeted group, more interest in the assignment as a whole, and lower levels of stress weighing on a person or group. ",Rebuttal
"While this may be true for some aspects, such as selecting the courses they wish to take, this should not be the case for summer assignments. This is because many students may take advantage of an opportunity to design their own summer projects, by making them as quick and easy as possible. While this may allow students to enjoy their summer break more, it compromises the very objective of summer assignments, that is, to enhance their education through having continuos learning instead of a complete break from school over the summer. ",Rebuttal
" Even though this may be partly true, the teachers can easily let the students, who are designing the projects, know what the students should learn from the projects and go from there. Students will have a better clue on what the projects need to be about and can make it interesting for the students, so that they continue to learn over their break. If students design the experiments, they can make sure the experiments aren't complicated or tedious either.",Rebuttal
"this is a flawed argument because most assignments given by teachers are strict and are only focused on a certain topic that not every student will take interest in. It's also important to give students a chance to be creative with their own guidelines and requirements, something that is restricted when a rubric designed to a teacher's expectations is given. Students would simply thrive more if handed an assignment they could create and build on their own.",Rebuttal
"those type of people would be wrong.

Many famous celebrities and scientists got to where they are or were because they had to be creative to reach that high. Furthermore, being creative on school projects makes one different and unique and many teens today should do that.",Rebuttal
unlike the teachers that have had experiences with other kids completing their assignments in the past.,Rebuttal
"This is a valid point, however, us students just want to improve ourselves. It can be embarrassing to lack understanding of what's going on in the classroom; it can also make students feel like failures, or even feel stupid. I know from personal experience that school leaves majority of the kids feeling like the most idiotic person alive; but that just motivates them to do more to improve so they won't think down on themselves. That is where the student-designing comes into play; if they made it too easy for themselves, they wouldn't be improving. If they're not improving, the continuous cycle of feeling like an idiot will not end.",Rebuttal
 However I myself am a student and I know once students get an assignment that they are eager to do your probably going to get their best work yet.,Rebuttal
"This may easily be countered by the teacher. Just because students would be able to design their projects, doesn't mean that the teacher doesn't oversee their actions. ",Rebuttal
"Teachers also have the ability to counter this by providing a calender for when certain parts of the project need to be turned in. One teacher would assign a summer project with the same guidelines for a whole class, which allows for the projects to have fairly similar requirements.",Rebuttal
"Although this argument has its merits, it is flawed; teachers realize that students do not put effort into projects that they are not invested in, so teachers have methods of getting students to become invested in their projects. ",Rebuttal
"However, many students today are extreme procrastinators and because of that their work would likely be average or below average. Teacher-designed projects are better because there would be a system that students can use to understand information better. If students were in charge it would become a jumbled messy puzzle of a project.",Rebuttal
It's good to have the students enthusiastic and engaged but it's not ensured whether they will learn something or not. The chance of a student designing a project that won't help them learn much is not beneficial and defeats the purpose of the summer projects. It's a teachers's job to make sure that students are learning so they will do their job and make sure they are. It's better to know for sure the students will learn with the teachers designing it rather than to not be sure with the students designing it. ,Rebuttal
"Its better to give them work that means something , work that teachers can study , so they can feel like as a teacher your just as invested in them as they have to be into you.",Rebuttal
"While it is true that the teachers know the content the best, they might not really know if it is something the students are capable of yet.

The teacher creating the summer assignment might not know how much the student has learned in the previous year so there is a chance that the summer assignment is too difficult for some.

Many times summer assignments are both made to review previous content and introduce new content the students will need when coming back to school.

Students can be left behind if the teacher made assignment is too difficult for the students.
",Rebuttal
but it is evident that students learn the way teachers would like us to learn for our entire school year.,Rebuttal
"But it is called break for a reason. But if we get work, might as well be fun. ",Rebuttal
"Although their problem solving skills may be tested, they are still more likely to design a less efficient project due to their lack of education preparation.

Where as a student lacks this education preparation, a teacher has spent years gathering it. Teachers can use their knowledge to create the perfect project for the class.
",Rebuttal
This argument is false because discipline is not always effective,Rebuttal
"Though, some of the school requires the teacher's to design a project not the student's because it is out of schools law because if they do something wrong, the teacher gets into trouble ",Rebuttal
"While this is possible, when a student is pushed, surprising results follow. In addition, giving students that necessary push is how we can create a brighter future.",Rebuttal
"However, if the projects were both educational and entertaining, then summer would be that much more enjoyable. It would also allow the content to soak in much better.",Rebuttal
"but this is not true. Ultimately, student-designed projects are better because they persuade students be more unique and creative.",Rebuttal
"If the projects were teacher-designed, then students can follow how to do the project correctly and lean the information that the teacher wants. While this may be true, it can also help students on their thinking skills. ",Rebuttal
a teacher should create guidelines based on creativity and display of knowledge rather than conformity.,Rebuttal
 students don't learn that way.,Rebuttal
As well as choosing something interesting to grade age kids. Most commonly students do not interact or don't want to interact with subjects or topics that don't interest them. ,Rebuttal
"However, having projects that are created by the student leaves room for interpretation, which could confuse students, and may take them in the wrong direction. ",Rebuttal
"However, students will quickly realize that what is easiest for them is not enough, and they will need to challenge themselves throughout these assignments to make sure that they are ready for the school year that is to come.",Rebuttal
" they have to understand that students know what they enjoy doing, and what they do not enjoy doing",Rebuttal
Although It can help them learn new things they have not learn before in school or any place they have been to before. ,Rebuttal
" student designed work will target trouble factors but teacher-designed will through a whole curriculum at you.
",Rebuttal
 not a lot of people can afford a tutor to help them. ,Rebuttal
"But if you were to do that grades and testing scores would rise because students are doing better.
",Rebuttal
"While their may be some ground behind these claims, giving free choice to students like this is like giving a car to a child. They don't know what they are doing and it's just going to hurt them. These students could also rig the system in their favor and make it so easy that they don't need to learn anything, therefor, making the point of the summer project entirely pointless.
",Rebuttal
"However, lowering the difficulty of a project doesn't cause a dramatic shift in student participation. As seen in several classrooms, in regards to homework, regardless of the difficulty in the assignment, many student willingly choose to not complete their assignment. Therefore, attendance or participation is an irrelevant factor when designing these projects. ",Rebuttal
Some students can fear having to design their own assignment could possibly add more stress from having to come up with a worthy project,Rebuttal
"but summer is the time for kids to relax, hang out with friends and family, and simply enjoy being stress free for a couple of months.",Rebuttal
"However, if students are given the idea that they can design their own project they will be excited for it, and start putting some serious thought into it. ",Rebuttal
"I wish we were mature enough to handle that responsability. But,the truth is we would make it as easy as possible. You may be thinking heck yea that sounds perfectly fine to me. But,in doing that you would defeat the whole point of doing the Summer project in the first place.",Rebuttal
"Yes this could work, giving the students freedom, but it also has been done before and the effect has been, contrary to popular belief, less then stellar. ",Rebuttal
"But to the contrary, a large body of evidence supports that with minimal guidance from the teacher over the summer, taking longer breaks from hard and tiresome work isn't that detrimental for your learning. ",Rebuttal
" However, by having the student design the project they will actually have more interest in it.",Rebuttal
"Though that's a valid reason, The teachers arent the ones who are actually doing the project and learning the new information given. The project might appeal to teachers interests but that won't help the students retain the information if its not something they enjoy or they find the criteria difficult. Whereas a student designed project will help the student because most of them have the same level of understanding the material and students can give each other tricks into memorizing and learning the information. ",Rebuttal
unfortunately certain students may take advantage of its given flexibility ,Rebuttal
but this is not a good idea.,Rebuttal
"Clearly, they are incorrect because student-based summer projects allow students to move at a pace that is appropriate for them and give students incentives to work harder. ",Rebuttal
"However, they are incorrect because everyone is unique, has their own way of understanding certain situations, and solves problems in different ways. ",Rebuttal
"However, they are wrong because student-designed projects are more beneficial to grades because they make students more motivated, and motivation leads to more effort placed into the project.",Rebuttal
" however, even if they are not the value of learning to think and the other benefits of student designed projects outweighs the over specified structure of the teacher designed projects. ",Rebuttal
but that is not always true. It is good to let students take over sometimes. It is also a great way for teachers to see the potential for their students. ,Rebuttal
student-designed projects allows the students to enjoy their summer while also learning new information. The project keeps the student thinking and using his/her knowledge which should be all that matters. Student-designed projects keeps students motivated and interested in learning.,Rebuttal
in the long run it will be more fun for them. ,Rebuttal
" Personally, I didn't agree with the position I got but, had to improvise and it made me feel like my opinion didn't matter; I was hiding behind this position my teacher gave me; especially since the issue was about my identity and how my ancestors were treated in the past. I didn't want to support the pros on slavery because, it was degrading to me and most students felt that way. Allowing teacher-designed projects doesn't establish a trusting relationship, making most students feel excluded.
",Rebuttal
" Teachers, however, are more familiar with the material for they have been teaching it for many years, they may understand what should and shouldn't be included because they have prior experience with the issue. This understanding of the necessary materials that students tend to forget is a significant factor when considering if the assignment should be student-designed or teacher-designed.",Rebuttal
"This proposition may apply to other situations, but it does not apply to this one because students may have difficulty structuring the assignment, resulting in a confusing structure that may confuse the students completing the assignment over summer. Experience is a very important factor when considering if summer assignments should be student-designed or teacher-designed and teachers have a significant and teachers are significantly more experienced than students.",Rebuttal
"However this argument does not stand because the length and difficulty of the assignments are designed to aid the student in learning, the assignment is not meant to be completed promptly, it is meant to be completed over the course of their long break. This pattern of laziness in students is an important contribution to the idea that summer assignments should not be student-designed. ",Rebuttal
"however, it is important that students begin to thrive in their academics over the summer.",Rebuttal
 but it is summer break after all and students have been pushing themselves for about ten months. These students are tired and adding stress to their vacation is cruel. ,Rebuttal
 making them student- designed will ensure that students make them based on things that they enjoy. ,Rebuttal
"however allowing students to design their own summer projects allows teachers to get to know students, students are more likely to complete the project, and allows students to be creative.",Rebuttal
"That reasoning is flawed due to the fact that my friend Generic_Name was given a similar project, but with guidelines saying the stuff that she could and could not do. She has always been better than me at turning in assignments. When I found out that I had turned in my project before her ,I was astonished. I asked her why she had not not done yet. She said that she had not even figured out what she was going to do. She was bound to do what she was told to do and she lost the creativity factor that she has always loved. Creativity is vital to a students success when doing projects. It ensured that every project is different and more entertaining than traditional projects. ",Rebuttal
"That is not the case, because of my friend Generic_Name. Generic_Name had to do a summer project last year and he had no idea what to do. He called me an asked what my project was on. I told him that me and just about everyone in our friend group was doing our project on History. When the school year started I asked him what he did it on, and he said his project was on Economics. When we got our grades back he had gotten the highest out of all of our friends. This just shows that it is more likely for someone to get a better grade when they get to choose a project subject or topic that they enjoy to do. ",Rebuttal
" that is not true. We are trusted to be responsible young men, women, or however people identify themselves. This project is not just about learning at school, but learning about life. When given the choice to do the project how we want to do it responsibility plays a huge factor. Factors like: Will we get it done on time, how will we do it, what topic will we do it on, and if the project actually had time spent on it or if it was just sped through. Us students need to be responsible in order to get in to good colleges, get good jobs, and live good lives. It all starts with projects like these. When all of these factors are put together they are more likely to make us more responsible in the long run. ",Rebuttal
"However, this freedom gives the students the opportunity to turn schoolwork into something that interests them, thus motivating them to do well.",Rebuttal
"however, teacher-designed projects would not prepare students for the upcoming school. During the school year, students are often required to create their own essay, lab design and presentation by teachers for a grade. Students completing a design that they have created will allow them to practice skills that teachers will require during the school year.",Rebuttal
". On the other hand, Teachers who have been working with students for years will know how to get a student to grasp the topics. Therefore, teachers designing assignments will know how to mold the assignment into a more enjoyable experience.
",Rebuttal
"Students are often detached from their learning; therefor, allowing them to create a project that could possibly worked on for months can help student regain their love of learning.",Rebuttal
" but they also want his or her students to learn/experience new things. Even though this reason validates itself, some students would not be able to gain the motivation that is needed to complete the project.",Rebuttal
"What they did not consider is that it is summer break and that most students would not be working hard anyways. To add, having student-designed projects would allow the students to be more enthusiastic about the project and work harder. If you expect students to work hard during summer why even have a summer break? It does not make any sense to give students a break that they still need to work during. ",Rebuttal
" a teacher-designed project could easily accomplish the same task.

A teacher-designed project that allows a student the freedom to learn and research topics that they find interesting, would combine the benefits of a student-designed project and a teacher-designed project.

The good formatting and difficulty of a teacher-designed project paired with the creative freedom of a student-designed project would result in an assignment that would allow a student to learn about topics that they find interesting, thus meeting the goal of a summer project.

Allowing a student to choose what topic they research will also benefit them in long run, as tend to retain information that they find interesting, meaning that the project will not be completed just to start the new school year off with a good grade. ",Rebuttal
 some students wouldnt like the topic or the teacher would want them to include certain things students might not know how to do or would like to include in their project. This will also give them less freedom of choosing there style of project. Teacher based projects would also be more educational based off of things they teach and wouldnt intrest students and it would be msot likely not turned in by the end of summer. ,Rebuttal
Studies say having year round school or even summer work will improve test scores and makes kids work harder. Summer work is a great idea. ,Rebuttal
"This argument, although enticing, is false, due to the fact that a student will gain more knowledge of a topic if it is of their choosing, instead of doing what many do now, which is simply going online and searching for the answers. A student can learn almost nothing except how to efffectively cheat from a teacher designed project.",Rebuttal
"If this is true, having a teacher designed project does not change that situation. The reality is that if a student is lazy and doesn't want to learn, they will not learn. ",Rebuttal
"While teachers have experience making projects and understand just how hard each component will make it. So using a middle ground will help teachers let their kids be independent. By letting the teachers give students a guideline on what exactly the project should or should not have, will let them feel secure about them finishing it. ",Rebuttal
"However, that has been the problem of education and why some students fail their classes because they aren,t given the option of what they want to do or how they want to do it. Students have their own way of learning. But the best way for them is them exploring on their own, finding their own interests of how they want to do their assignments. Sometimes students learn by comparing things of what they like to what they have to do to complete their task.",Rebuttal
However allowing students to design their own projects will allow them to challege themselfes . They will also probley pick a project that is enjoybal to them and will make the learning experiance so much better and the students will most likely complte a project they ejoy doing. Also allowing students to design their own project wont make them be careless it will allow them to make adult choices on their own . This being said will show how much they are growing up and how they can make good choices on their own and how they can do it by themselfs . Allowing them to pick it will mostlikly make them make better choices much rather then carless ones . ,Rebuttal
And while it may be good that the student is interested in the topic they are working on it sort off defeats the purpose of the project. Because the projects are suppose to be a introduction into the next year and a way for the teacher to learn about the students ,Rebuttal
" This resulted in the majority of homework assignments being non-graded. Many students are looking at this as a way to get out of doing work, but this will always come back to hurt them in the future. A student who completes all of the work assigned, regardless of if it is graded or not, has a much higher chance of doing well in the class compared to a student who only does the required amount of work. ",Rebuttal
it is less practical to operate in such a way,Rebuttal
" While this can be true, teachers can create an overall rubric that addresses the key elements that each project must include, no matter the topic. ",Rebuttal
"However, if students were to design their own projects and chose their own topics from what they are interested in, they would have more interest in the completing the project they chose. ",Rebuttal
"Being able to come back to school next year will be less stressful without trying to remember things that have been forgotten about over a certain period of time. It is always best to stay up-to-date with all the things that are taught. It also feels nice to carry around knowledge known to themselves, but not to others. Students may be updated with their knowledge to the point where they might show their teachers a few things",Rebuttal
 but what they do not consider is that students could express themselves and teach their teachers and classmates something new about their experience during their summer break. ,Rebuttal
"However, if they take time and pace themselves the project shouldn't take that much time; since it's based on what they previously learned.",Rebuttal
"However, most teachers are still reachable through their school email or any other way that you would use to contact them to ask questions.",Rebuttal
"However, it would be more helpful to challenge the students on new topics to see where they are at, at comprehending the new topic. ",Rebuttal
"Although, I think that a student-designed project is better because students should have easier work over summer break, and it gives them more freedom on how to do their project. ",Rebuttal
"While this opinion is relevant, it is not a valid point because students will end up making their work too easy. ",Rebuttal
" On the other hand, teachers may have it easier figuring out what interest all or almost all of the students. Teachers could conduct surveys and have students fill out their interest, and the teachers can design the project based on the answers provided by the survey. Although, this method may not be entirely great for each individual student, it would be great for the majority of them. ",Rebuttal
"but teacher designed projects prevent students from acquiring real world experiences, freedom, and an extra learning experiences that a student designed project would provide. ",Rebuttal
"However, students would barely learn anything about the topic that is chosen for them, because they are forced to work on that topic. Also when the students are back in school and they have to present their projects, the other students might not even pay attention to their classmates presenting, because they would already know the information that is going to be said. The classmates that I've talk to in my school state to my that they have more fun with a project when they get to pick their own topic to choose from, and tend to pay attention more to when their classmates present different projects topics.",Rebuttal
"Whenever I'm given a summer assignment, I know for a fact it I won't even look at the assignment until maybe about a few days before the first day of school. Which would lead to me rushing a lazily put together assignment and a not so good grade. Giving students the opportunity to design their own assignments will lead to students rushing their projects, and justifying it by claiming that the level of quality meets the standards of their assignment. ",Rebuttal
" However, if students are allowed to pursue their interests, they will be motivated to do their projects. ",Rebuttal
They are wrong. We deserve to make school the best experience for ourselves and for our peers around us.,Rebuttal
This is why student-designed projects are something school should provide students with. It gives them something productive to do while learning traits they'll use all life long not only at school. Teaching them dicipliny and dedication. ,Rebuttal
there is a higher chance it would make them less prepared for the course. Students would struggle to maintain responsibility towards the assignment.,Rebuttal
"But it would have to go through trails to make sure the project is actually safe to do at home by their selves. Therefore in the long run it would be more work for the student and the teachers if the students came up with the summer project by themselves. A safer and better way to do things would to compromise the options for students,the teachers could come up with the project ideas and have the students vote on the one they would rather do. As well as having many options for students to pick from over the summer so they are not limited to or only have one option to chose from.",Rebuttal
"However, students who design these summer projects can easily be given a description of the required curriculum to guide them while they design their projects. This will allow them to find ways they can incorporate the material into an achievable project.",Rebuttal
"but that thought is incorrect. Giving the student the choice will cause them to choose a topic they are interested in and willing to work on, that even may not have been looked into before.",Rebuttal
This problem could be solved if the student was working on something he or she has chosen and is interested in.,Rebuttal
 Others would say that what is important is the student not the assignment. These summer assignments should be helping the students learn and help them be themselves.,Rebuttal
"The fact of the matter is, teachers will implement guidelines and requirements for the projects that students will design, which will keep them from being able to cut corners with their work. If teachers were to design these projects, students would lose a valuable opportunity to learn the life skill of self-direction. ",Rebuttal
"We have those important three months of freedom to do as we choose, teachers should understand that and give us the oppurtunities of working passionately with no boundaries.
",Rebuttal
 I believe this forces them to be more open minded ,Rebuttal
"However, this argument presumes that all teachers don't let their students be creative in their own way by assigning similar assignments or projects. As teachers have control on what they assign to students, they should put in a little more thought into what they want their students to do. We as students are capable in doing the projects our teacher assigns us do it but it wouldn't be too much fun or diverse if everyone had nearly the same information and knowledge on every project given. ",Rebuttal
", but that just isn't the case. A student-designed project allows for students to incorporate their personal values and gives them the opportunity to create new friendships.",Rebuttal
"however, this is not always the case.",Rebuttal
"But teachers understand that and know that the only way their students will complete their project is that if it wasn't boring. Even during the school year teachers try to make their lessons as interesting as possible to keep their kids involved. Summer projects don't have to be paper work, it can also be something that has to be physically done. So, that means that you'll have fun, new experiences, they might also be required to be done with a friend which makes the project a whole lot better. So I still agree with teacher-designed projects as they not only help us but keep us on the right path of what we should be doing and learning while having fun.",Rebuttal
"the only person that knows a students comfortable limit of work around their daily routine is the student themselves, during the summer many of them could be out of town for majority of their break and to which they wont be able to have enough time to balance their own routine and the schools summer assignment",Rebuttal
"On the other hand, learning in a fun way can hinder how much the student learns. Teacher-designed projects are better for students' academics. ",Rebuttal
but summer projects are once again just about assuring that students are learning and usually not followed up on as true assignments. The question of if a student learned the same thing as everyone else should not be as important as them just learning something relevant in general. ,Rebuttal
but the students who took the class ultimately know what the students will need to pass the final tests. ,Rebuttal
"However, allowing teachers to take charge on these assignments will prevent the students from exploring new ideas and varying their knowledge.",Rebuttal
" Since every student is different, every student benefits with the power to work at their own pace. ",Rebuttal
"On the other hand, teachers can simply just note as a minor requirement that students must make one quick connection from their project to any theme that will be studied in the school year. ",Rebuttal
" However, student-designed projects are not always the best reflection of the students and their work ethic.",Rebuttal
 They should be student designed because if students are supposed to have a three month break from school after being in school for over 9 months and the school gives them a project its already wrong. So by giving them the ability to do their own project would be 10x more effective than teachers giving it,Rebuttal
"Even though self teaching is a very good way to learn information, I believe that learning from someone that has mastered the information and teaches it every single year is way better and easier for the student trying to learn the information.",Rebuttal
"they are wrong. No mater what topic or subject is chosen for the summer project, or for anything in life, there is always something more that a person could learn and gain from it. Students know what they like, so they can chose the topic but in the end its still a project and its something the students must put work and thought into, pushing them to grow. When the project is student-designed the person doing the project would have more motive to finish the project well and learn even more on the topic, than if a teacher designed the project. Having the students interest in a summer project could make them want to learn more, instead of forcing them into more stress. ",Rebuttal
 It actually the opposite half of any schools in the world may have students who is into art or into designing things.,Rebuttal
but students need to become independent and be able to learn about a topic important to them without a teacher spoon-feeding every little fact. Independent learning will allow for children to build up information on a topic and eventually use that knowledge to follow their interests to an enjoyable occupation. ,Rebuttal
they are wrong because there are a lot of bright students that don't need a teacher's help with a lot of things and im pretty sure that they don't need help on deciding on something as simple as a project that can be anything that they want. ,Rebuttal
 however they are wrong because that little piece of freedom to decide what they are going to do on a project is getting one step closer to be a self depending person.,Rebuttal
" Learning is retaining, if the students do not retain any of the knowledge they are just trying to complete another teacher-given assignment, and they are not truly learning.",Rebuttal
but their reasoning is flawed because students do not have the knowledge that teachers have gained from their hundreds of students and the years spent in college to learn how to teach.,Rebuttal
"the truth is that teachers spend an enormous amount of time with their students not only in class, but also after and before school",Rebuttal
" but it is entirely based off the false assumption that most students would even have the focus and determination to make up a project like this all on their own.
",Rebuttal
 I disagree. Studies show that a majority of students cheat and/or recieve answers from other students regarding to homework outside of the classroom.,Rebuttal
" To avoid this teachers should create a rubric that the students must follow. This allows the teacher to grade the project on effort, creativity and neatness but also allowing the student to do what they please with the assignment.",Rebuttal
"However, teachers can discipline them by reporting them or writing them up. ",Rebuttal
But most students wont end up turning it in before school starts. ,Rebuttal
 however the whole project development will be overseen by teachers and adults to make sure the projects are fair.,Rebuttal
" Summer projects should be teacher designed because of benefits to teachers such as planning ahead, projects being easier to grade, and not having to worry about students doing the wrong things.",Rebuttal
"But, schools will have a raise in student participation with the summer project if schools allow them choice of their own topic. Schools will notice students doing their summer projects that didnt do them the prior year when the topic was assigned. As well as letting the students choose their own topic schools are letting the students let their teacher know a little bit about themselves with whatever topic they choose. This allows the teachers to better understand their students before the year really kicks off.",Rebuttal
" but even if the project is simple that student might still learn something from it, and its better than receiving no project at all. ",Rebuttal
"I believe that a more structured assignment is not necesarily a good thing. While a structured assignment does have its benefits a more open ended project allows students to work more creatively within the peramiters provided, and ensures that the end result better reflects the time and effort put forth by the student. Another important benefit provided by open ended projects is that it makes it harder to cheat or plagarize from other students. If every student is given the task of completing the exact same project it makes it very easy to take the work of another student and slightly edit it for thier own project. This problem is largely elliminated with student designed projects because no two students will be doing the same exact project, and everyones projects will be unique to them. ",Rebuttal
But a techer designed project with a more rigid structure wouldn't change that. Students who have no intrest in the class or project will look for the easiest solution that requires the least ammount of effort no matter what kind of project they are given. Teacher designed projects only get rid of any chance of engaging students that would otherwise be disintrested. ,Rebuttal
"However, summer projects should be teacher designed because of the benefits for later such as learning soemthing new and learning time management. Also teachers should design the summer projects of the benefits students can get now like less stress and the ability to have more time on their project.",Rebuttal
" That wouldnt work because they dont know anything about the topic, and they will procrastinate and do it the last week of the summer making it rushed and it wont be beneficial to them at all. ",Rebuttal
"Pushing creativity is good for students, but in I feel like a summer project is something you do so you can have knowledge of the topic when school starts, instead of something fun youll forget about in a week or two ",Rebuttal
others say that the teacher can simply make a standard rubric where any topic could possibly fit the criteria. ,Rebuttal
"While that may be true, the purpose of the assignment is to inspire the students to learn and if the students don't enjoy the topic they were assigned, it defeats the entire purpose of the assignment since it discourages them from learning more over the summer. ",Rebuttal
"but it is summer time! Let the kids live it up for a couple months, they will be right back in to the stress of school right back in August.
",Rebuttal
"However, students need to be challenged because if they don't, they will have trouble finishing assignments from school. This reason shows that projects should be teacher-designed because if it were decided by the students, they would try to make it as simple as possible.",Rebuttal
That is not true at all because a summer project's purpose is to teach students in some way without having a teacher around them. Summer projects can be really useful and can help a student learn when it is designed by teacher.,Rebuttal
" Well, not really because the things that the students did and learned while doing the project will help a student succeed in school. The school year can be easier for the students if the summer projects are made by the teachers. ",Rebuttal
however with regulations from school boards and teachers it can be avoided. ,Rebuttal
while the student-paced learning allows for mistakes to be made in order for growth over long breaks.,Rebuttal
" However, it is better for a teacher to design the summer project because the teacher knows all the information that a student needs to be successful in their class. It is better for a student to have information about what they actually need to know to pass the class than something that just interests them. ",Rebuttal
"What's the problem with students designing their summer project? It's not hurting anybody, it's at their own type of pace, they are not being rushed into something they may not be ready for, and I could go on and on about it. In the students' mind, they probably think if they design their own time to do the summer projects, when they are done with the assignments, the work will more than likely be more proifficent and way more precise, rather than teachers trying to assign them the assginments at the wrong time for some students. I would that the teachers would take that to head and be more aware of what students have going on.",Rebuttal
 it doesn't establish a strong foundation of knowledge on the course,Rebuttal
 but this can be easily fixed by simply showing some topics they can use but not forcing the topics on the students to use it and also allow students to find something about that topic or something that can relate to that topic. ,Rebuttal
they will try harder to explain it in their own words because that is the top the student wanted to talk about and wants to make an effort to show what they are capable of doing when the student is allowed to pick an idea for their own project. ,Rebuttal
No matter what design is chosen this choice will not make everyone happy. Also there will always be students that just wont do the assignment no matter who chose the design ,Rebuttal
but I believe if students were given that opportunity they would try to do the least and easiest amount of work.,Rebuttal
"While this may be true for some, not all students are the same.",Rebuttal
"This may also be true, students challenged throughout the whole school year, they don't necessarily need another one over their summer break. Additionally, if a student does just choose the easy route, they will be the ones paying for it in the end. Regardless of these points, students would benefit more from designing their own projects, and the overall point of the project is to benefit the student. ",Rebuttal
but teachers should be able to teach what is needed in school.,Rebuttal
" teachers are human and don't always know what's best for their students to learn. Each person learns differently in both ways and paces. When teachers design assignments, it's, this is what your assignment is and that's that. When students do it, it becomes more unique and beneficial for each one. Also, that way students can't just copy each other's work.",Rebuttal
"However, giving the students freedom of expression can better the all around process as well as the grading aspect. They can pick their own topics while still working from the teachers guide lines, making the grading process relatively the same. Grading projects that were more thought out is a lot better than grading poorly done projects that the students didn't truly care about. In addition to all of these positive points, there are many more that support.",Rebuttal
"To this I say that teachers don't give students enough credit and that once something has been taught it should be solid in a student mind otherwise it wasn't taught correctly. I've seen some crafty ways students try to get by an assignment that's hard to cheat on and if summer assignments where student designed this would only get worse. Some students are very determined to not do their assignments the ""correct"" way; I've seen people spend more energy trying to cheat than they would have if they had done their assignment properly. ",Rebuttal
"This is absolute blaspheme although I agree that education is important it is ultimately up to the student to weigh their choices, and make the best decision for themselves. I am 90% confident that summer assignments don't fall within most students priority list. ",Rebuttal
" however, these self-assigned projects could easily be swept under the rug, especially in the midst of an exciting summer break. More time, thought, and preparation must go into a student designed project, discouraging students from setting aside appropriate time to devote to the project, because they view it as too challenging.",Rebuttal
but I believe the student should design the projects because it teaches organization and it keeps the student interested.,Rebuttal
"This is true, but not just for student designed projects. Like students, teachers can design different types or styles of projects allowing all types of learning for the student.",Rebuttal
"however, in reality, most students simply will not put enough effort into it. Perhaps if teenagers were more passionate about school during the summer it would work, but until then, teachers remain the best candidate for designing summer assignments.",Rebuttal
it could also really hurt the students grade. As it is a summer project you want your grade on it to be really good so you can start off the year right.,Rebuttal
"While this is a good point, it can be easily counteracted with the simple statement of, if these student aren't able to create and be slightly independent now, When will they get another chance? This why the teacher-design isn't a better idea.",Rebuttal
"However, teachers fail to consider there are alternative ways to learning that help can students compared to how they would expect it to be taught. ",Rebuttal
"However, some students not have information about summer projects and they did not like to complete the summer projects from teachers in the summer.",Rebuttal
"Even if they do that, it will probably be either something rather difficult or something you need to finish within a month. If students were in charge of that they would be able to do a project that's easiest and best for them and within a reasonable time frame. ",Rebuttal
 but I believe that student-designed projects would be much more efficient and helpful to students. ,Rebuttal
"I believe that this wouldn't be the case because the whole reason behind a student-designed project is that every project will be different and unique to that student. Students wouldn't need help because the project would be about them, unlike a teacher-designed one. ",Rebuttal
"However, many teachers assign projects without thinking of the difficulty or issues that students could face. What if a student doesn't know anything about the topic? Well the teachers expects them to learn it themselves which is another reason giving students the ability to choose for them self is a good idea. A project designed by the teacher can take longer than they expect if students aren't fully educated about the topic. Consequently, this leads to students wasting more of their summer from trying to learn about then complete the teachers project.",Rebuttal
"but it would not benefit them because it makes it easy on themselves, therefore they aren't learning anything.",Rebuttal
"This method, however, could lead to sloppiness and the lack of thorough and detailed work regarding their own created prompt. Students would also lack a rubric to use to outline and detail the expectations of the instructor. ",Rebuttal
"a student can chose anything which doesn't improve their learning. If a student chooses skateboarding, video games, sports, or food it defeats the purpose of the summer project. ",Rebuttal
"Though these are both good ideas. They don't hold as many pros as the teacher-designed project does. Teachers often add a lot of creativity to their projects and even have a rubric section for maybe 5-10 points just for creativity and colorfulness itself. Teachers also often allow kids to atleast pick the topic of the project or what they want to research to encourage them to do something they like, but still hold the same guidelines for the attatched project. ",Rebuttal
"however, there might not be much progress done if the students aren't being directed/guided and told step by step on what their teacher expects from them and how the project should be represented. In this case it'd seem like a better option is to leave the students into leading their own work. ",Rebuttal
students are more likely to understand how to do the project if they are able to design it.,Rebuttal
"However since both the students and the teacher agreed with each others decisions, thats what made the class engaging not just the teacher enjoying what he teaches. ",Rebuttal
"but it can be seen as so much more than that. It will improve everyone's ability to work with others, which is a crucial skill in life. It will be challenging to combine and compromise on different ideas. If used correctly, you can figure out more about yourself, for example, if you like to work individually verses in a group, what kind of learning style you want the project to be, what the project is on, how much work you're willing to put into it, and so many other things.",Rebuttal
", but that simply isn't true. Our education system is built on the information that teachers provide, and because of their years of teaching, professors definitely know how to engage a student and make them eager to learn ",Rebuttal
" teacher-designed projects are meant to follow the criteria of the course and make sure that the assignment is reasonable, while student-designed may only cover one-fifth of their learning.",Rebuttal
"If the teacher and students come to an agreement, it can increase the students participation and make the project learning time more enjoyable. Ultimately, teacher-designed projects benefit the time spent and the amount of information received, with the help of student input, the participation from students will have a greater impact on the learning of the students.",Rebuttal
"but students aren't enjoying the assignment because they aren't able to express their knowledge that is different from everyone else. Letting the students create their own projects will give them the opportunity to be creative and express their ideas. Additionally, students will continue to use or remember the skills and knowledge prior to help them create their projects. ",Rebuttal
"The problem is that the Seniors would continue to try and fudge their way through the system.

They wouldn't be able to effectively learn and maintain the information if they are left to their own agendas.

A student at Generic_School, Generic_Name, was told to do a project over the summer while following guidelines, while another student was told to just do a project.

Both would take a test when they got back from break.

Which student would most likely do better on the exam?

The one who was assigned the guidelines, or the one that was more freelanced?

Students need to follow guidelines in order to perform well on exams and the future.
",Rebuttal
"however, this can limit usage of students' creative prowess, applicable knowledge and abilities that maximize creative output and work-management tendencies in the long run. ",Rebuttal
but I don't believe that would be the best way to go about it.,Rebuttal
"Although,some students might be too busy or not even take the time to design one. If the teacher already have the project designed that all they have to do is take the time to do it.",Rebuttal
"However, this way, the projects will be less informative. Meaning students will not only waste their time, but they will also be less prepared for school when it starts again. As mentioned before, teacher-designed projects will only have a positive impact on students for their own good due to teachers experience of teaching.
",Rebuttal
but not everyone would get to show their creative abilities. Creativity is an important factor that goes into making a project great.,Rebuttal
"but I believe that everyone's knowledge is different, so allowing them to design their projects would accompany their knowledge best. Thus, being able to express their knowledge is another important component in allowing students to pick their own project.",Rebuttal
" I believe that if students are given a choice in what they want to do for their project, that it gives them more motivation to work on it and continue to make it better. Showing work ethic in an assignment is also an important aspect to allowing them to choose their own projects. ",Rebuttal
"However, because teachers are the experts and oversee the education of their students in their position, they know what and how to use projects for the students benefit. Both the teacher will exercise their position as a leader and student practice their creativity with the freedom these projects allow for.",Rebuttal
this factor becomes insignificant when the students don't learn the material they are expected to. ,Rebuttal
"However, not every student has that maturity level or creativity level to design a project that meets their teachers standards. Majority of students rely on teachers to design something for them that would best fit their criteria to continue learning.
",Rebuttal
"Rather than having a teacher design a number of students summer projects, the students themselves should have control over designing their own time-consuming summer projects. They should be able to design their projects themselves because they're the ones who're going to be completing it and doing all the research and work for it.",Rebuttal
but they are and it teaches students a different skill when they're designing the project. ,Rebuttal
" But at the same time, students directing their own project risk getting the the wrong idea and not grasping the main purpose and drive.",Rebuttal
"But this is why I think students should come up with their own project designs and then have the teachers check their idea before they start working, so that their project isn't too easy or short",Rebuttal
"but turning back onto the point of the Science Fair if they created an agenda for the students to follow, then they would be able to grade it efficently.",Rebuttal
"This is a great point that would come up in these debates, but a simple way of solving this issue is to make the project based on the information of the class by allowing the students to choose something that would be taught in the class either later or in the beginning of the year and to solve the issue with taking a quiz based on the assignments, the student could describe the topic they did their project about and allow it so that it was vague allowing for students to write about whatever their topic was which makes it so that everyone could do the quiz and it wouldn't have to be based on a teacher-designed project.

This allows for teachers to be able to test on this knowledge and still allows the student to learn whatever they want to learn with their project. ",Rebuttal
 they don't know as much as a teacher would. ,Rebuttal
" If the students wants to be truly seen as a responsible, young adults, then they should not take advantage of the project and they should put the correct amount of effort into the assignment.",Rebuttal
" But summer vacations are supposed to refresh students. Students will not be under a lot of pressure, but they will still be able to learn when they design their own projects for the summer. ",Rebuttal
"but those projects are done in a classroom, where the teacher can easily help the students and provide valuable advice.",Rebuttal
but if the teacher assigns the project at least they will know what the project is.,Rebuttal
"That is true, but they may also feel obligated to do the project if the teacher designs and assigns it.",Rebuttal
Why would some of the students choose student-design when some of the students may get it done but not all? students should choose teacher-designed so they wont have to struggle coming up with an idea for their project. so instead they can get get their project done quick and easy because their teacher gave them directions. The teacher would want all of his students to complete the project and also have a good summer so therefore i would choose teacher-designed. Students either that same week or that next week get the project done the month you received it so you wont have to worry about it later on in the summer.,Rebuttal
"This feature, however, proves to be more harmful to a student than helpful as it reults in students starting the year with vastly different levels of understanding. When students enter the year at different levels of understanding, the teacher has to spend a considerable amount of time at the beginning of the year making sure their students are caught up to the same place, wasting both the teacher's time as well as the time of students who are more prepared",Rebuttal
"having a restrictive project with so many directions and rules will not benefit the student in any way, nor will it help the teacher.",Rebuttal
but most of the time if the student isn't interested in the project then why would they complete something they aren't interested in? ,Rebuttal
"however, students designing their own projects gives them a better chance at letting them explore the ideas they can generate on their own.",Rebuttal
"however, student-designed is better because its made by a student and it will less stressful, while teacher-designed will be a lot harder and frustrating to do.",Rebuttal
"While this reasoning is understandable, it is false because when students are able to design their own projects that focus on their interest and needs they are more likely to benefit from them and they are more likely to put aside the time to complete them.",Rebuttal
" they however, are wrong. They are wrong because during school, students are always handed work by the teacher and this would be a good opportunity for the teacher to grade something that they are not expecting.",Rebuttal
Both ideas have great benefits and help the student in their own way. ,Rebuttal
"However, the students' overall concensus as to what the work load is would be more congruent with how future classes would perceive it. ",Rebuttal
allow some type of creativity in their life because you cannot tell me that you expect students to be told later on in the future to do this and this tep by step. That is never gonna happen no one is ever gonna hold another persons hand all the days of their life thta is why they need a bit of freedom =now so they can have some experience with it when they get older.,Rebuttal
 but this is not true. I believe that the pros of students being responsible and managing their time to create their own projects outweighs the pros of teachers leading projects and possibly having results that aren't very stellar.,Rebuttal
" students know what best suites their own knowledge and what levels they can withstand.
",Rebuttal
" however, they should be student-designed because it helps them develop new skills while learning at the same time.",Rebuttal
But summer assignments exist to assure students continue to learn during their break. Having them assign work to themselves would defeat the purpose of doing summer projects. ,Rebuttal
This is statement is false though because most students will put less effort in so that they can get the project over quickly. Teachers should clearly assign summer projects because they have more experience with the matter.,Rebuttal
"Even though more effort may lead to more learning this statement is still inaccurate because this argument may not apply to everyone because everyone is different and they get to determine how the project is made. Frankly, students are lazy by nature and them deciding how the project is made can lead to time wasting and bad motivation to learn.",Rebuttal
" However, not only is that a big hassle students would more then likely forget over the long break. Asking questions and not being able to receive an answer can lead to a lot of students downfall on the project.",Rebuttal
"They want to help the students meet their goals and expect them to set high expectations for themselves, but when a student realizes the work given over the summer is just like any other classwork they will set it aside. If teachers are able to make a project that is fun and can be beneficial to learning, teenagers or kids will do it and will be more prepared when the next year comes. ",Rebuttal
" Although this is correct, regardless of whether or not the summer assignment is chosen by teachers or students, it's primary purpose will still be fulfilled: to keep the student's brain active throughout the break. In fact, if chosen by students, the chances of the goal to be fulfilled greatly increase, contrary to how it would be if it were to be chosen by teachers. ",Rebuttal
", but how is it an equal opportunity if not everyone's brain grasps concepts the same way?",Rebuttal
", they leave students unmotivated and bored, but learning shouldn't be boring.
",Rebuttal
"However, having these projects be student-designed can show the creativity of a student. ",Rebuttal
"I think teachers will understand that it's summer break, so they won't assign you something overly complicated, but they will challenge your brain, so you can keep using the skills you learned throughout the year to prepare you for next school year.",Rebuttal
"there dwarf in comparison to the benefits students gain from working on a topic that excites and engages them. Many students, especially as they grow older and advance in grades, feel trapped and burdened by school mandated work. Believing it to be a chore rather an opportunity to learn as this work should be. Not only does owning the ability to choose ones project topic offer that taste of freedom students have been looking for, it gives schools a grasp of the creativity of their students: viewing what they can do without school assigned work and projects. In fact, many schools develop programs based on the specialized abilities students poses",Rebuttal
"a student should reserve the right to select his or her assignment; however, perhaps a compromise could be reached. Since it is still a teachers class, the project should be of the students choice; excpet, it must pertain to a topic covered within the year. Therefore, students still have the freedom and ability to choose what topics interested them, but the project still pertains to a lesson.",Rebuttal
This may help students feel less overwhellmed however it will not prepare them for the rest of their schooling years because as previously stated the course work only gets harder and simplifying the work load will not do anything. ,Rebuttal
"but teacher-designed projects are more easy going for students to begin and meet expectations, students will learn about useful subjects for the class, and knowledge and wisdom will be gained while exploring new things.",Rebuttal
But there is just too many students who would cheat and not give effort to the project.,Rebuttal
"While understandable, this is inaccurate because students already have a lot of responsibilities. For instance, my friend Generic_Name, has a part time job, plays baskeball, and tutors her younger siblings. It would be difficult for her to create a summer project because she has so many other responsbilities. If she would have to design a summer project she wouldn't be able to give her time to her other priorities. Furthermore, making a summer project would result in her being stressed out.",Rebuttal
 it is not in the students best interest for this to take place.,Rebuttal
"Although it may just apply pressure and stress on the students which is what we don't want happening to them.

We shouldn't make kids design their own projects especially if most don't want to do it. ",Rebuttal
"While understandable, that reasoning is flawwed due to the fact that teachers monitor students work in order to keep them on track.",Rebuttal
"However they're wrong, because if they're going to give students projects during summer break. The students should be able to design it how they want to. Who wants a project they have to do and can't design it how they want to. That isn't fair to the students at all. ",Rebuttal
 they dont understand how beneficial it is for them. Keeping your brain fresh with new knowledge everyday is what is needed in order to retain the information.,Rebuttal
would be in an entirely different scenario as these are projects assigned in the summer.,Rebuttal
"Although following a specific guild line ensures the student will complete the required task thoroughly, it forbids the act of joy. Students are already in school for ten months of the year following a stricted guideline in how to complete a certain assignment, if schools assign a teacher-designed project over the summer it would feel as if they are coming in the way of students summer break. If this project is teacher-designed it would also show students that schools are more biased towards their opinions.",Rebuttal
"Yes, that is true, but what is the point of making a project interesting and relevant if i they dont seem to find the motivation to do it so they just end up cheating like some of the kids do ",Rebuttal
if it wasn't for the teachers and the work they give we wouldn't know anything including them because they had teachers also so they know whats best for us. and yes free time is important but in reality youre wasting your time just goofing off and losing time that you could be working to be ready for the next school year and you wouldnt be able to forget the things you did during the past school year.,Rebuttal
"Education is a self discovered path that must be navigated by the student. Apart from the fact that teachers already have so much on their plate, and adding project planning on top will place more stress on them, a student has the right to challenge themselves as needed. ",Rebuttal
"I personally don't like the summer assignments teachers give us because they require the whole summer to do. Kids like me want to have fun, not stay at home and read a book all day.",Rebuttal
student-designed projects are ideal in fostering intellectual growth for students because students are permitted to seek a plethora of sources which enhances their learning and they strengthen their retention of the subject due to constant exposure with the material.,Rebuttal
" During high school, students need this time to learn more than just history or math, they need to learn how to manage their own lives. Giving them the right to design their own project is the best decision for both students and teachers.  ",Rebuttal
"However, we can observe time and time again in every day life that critical-thinking tasks can teach skills at an exponentially greater rate. Take an athlete for example, basketball and soccer players will often dribble while counting the number of fingers a partner holds up in front of them. Just like in a school setting, this exercise builds good habits and requires people to apply their newly learned skills in unfamiliar circumstances. ",Rebuttal
 teacher designed summer projects better surve in the childs best interest,Rebuttal
"This may be true, but considering that throughout the normal school year teachers design and assign work to students, it would be more beneficial to give students the opportunity to learn how to take charge of their own work.",Rebuttal
"However, if the students themselves design the project, it is not garanteed they will apply information and tools vital for next year. Even if they are given a rubric specifically outlining the nessicary elements needed within the project, the assignment will still be lacking an example of the types of projects the teacher is likely to assign in the future, the teachers educating style, and will not exibit the true difficulty of the class. The student will still be able to show their personality through their work within the teacher designed project, so it will still display individuality; but at the same time preparing them for the teachers class specifically. ",Rebuttal
"However, students technically do learn because when they are doing research about their project, they are reading and learning things about it. Also, if the students need help with their project, they can get the help they need from a parent, friend, or a family member.",Rebuttal
" But, it is not smart to give students complete freedom as they will have someone who wants something specific out of them when they get a job. For example, when I got my first job at an ice cream store I had to figure things out myself as I went, but I could not just do whatever I wanted. I had a task to complete that was specified by my boss, but he was not there every step of the way and left me to figure some things out on my own. That is what summer projects should emulate for high school students, while projects should be much more structured for younger kids. ",Rebuttal
"In fact however, if students were able to design their own project they may not even feel like they are doing a project.

Given the freedom students would have access to when designing their own project, the students may not even look upon it as a project but more as just an activity they are doing through the summer. ",Rebuttal
Summer projects are beneficial but students don't understand that. The students been in school for so long that at this point they just want summer break to come. Summer is time where the students can relax their minds and be stress free for little. You also gotta understand that some students don't have the time for it. ,Rebuttal
the benefits of student-designed summer projects are incomparable.,Rebuttal
"However, If these summer projects were student-based it would really never get done because students like to spend their free time having fun and so students would procrastinate and never work on it till last minute in which wouldn't help them learn anything.",Rebuttal
"Although, student based projects allow students to be responsible for doing it or not, the students who aren't responsible wouldn't put these projects as a priority to them and slack off and instead do what they want instead of trying to learn things that would benefit them throughout the school year, while teacher-based projects would make students buckle down and give them a deadline to turn these projects in when school starts making it a priority to work on for every student.",Rebuttal
"However, if teachers aren't held responsible for these projects, some students wouldn't be able to learn much compared to those who actually did the project during the summer, making the students who didn't try or challenge themselves fall more and more behind everyone else ultimately hurting their success within the school year. ",Rebuttal
 Though with it being student-deigned it would bring many problems. ,Rebuttal
"However, this produces a non-effective and inefficient summer project to keep learning over break. If students were to make these summer projects easy his or her brain would not grow and really understand the material to keep himself or herself learning over the break. He or she could easily forget how to properly face situations and find difficulty problem solving questions and/or answers. ",Rebuttal
students would be able to be more successful and have a more enjoyable time with their own designed project ,Rebuttal
When a teacher designed project will give students the opprotunity to widen their knowledge ,Rebuttal
"On the other hand, it would take away the idea of creativity and the chance to express ones self had the project been student designed. Which would lead to less effort being put into the projects. If the students are given the chance to do as they please freely they can put more time and effort into it. ",Rebuttal
"This is entirely unrealistic, it is not fair for me to get 2 pages of math and be able to finish it in five minutes while it take my sister three hours.

It is not fair that I dont recieve the help I need in history because my sisters needs were put above mine.

With this in mind think about what school is truly here to do for the young generations that pass through its system. Yes, school is here to encourage learing, but in its basic foundation school is here to prepare us for the future. ",Rebuttal
but this is not true. ,Rebuttal
"it is entirely possible that students, who simply want some free time and zero stress during break, will opt to come up with questions and problems that are fairly easy to understand and answer, thus nullifying the whole point of the project. Hence another reason why it is best if teachers design these projects for the students. ",Rebuttal
"however, student-based projects are a better choice because it gives more creative freedom to the students, the project itself becomes more enjoyable, and helps students continue learning even when out of school.",Rebuttal
"However, during the first few days of school where the staff is busy setting everything up, teachers could take that opportunity to quickly revise a bit on where everyone left off before continuing with their new lessons; as well as assigning homework similar to last school year.",Rebuttal
"However, student-based projects allow students to apply themselves to a subject that they have an actual interest in and produce far better results than the ""equal"" teacher-based projects do",Rebuttal
but most of the time teachers are correct.,Rebuttal
"although, what makes a student-designed project differ from a teacher-designed project is simply because the project is made by oneself and therefore, one can get a better understanding of themselves, and find the necessary materials to use for the project. ",Rebuttal
" they are not the students. Occurring over the summer, school projects should be designed by the student because of the students knowledge of their struggles, they are their own success, and it should be a comfortable leaning opportunity. ",Rebuttal
"I do still believe that students should design their own projects.
",Rebuttal
"fear not. Before a school year is over teachers shall be tasked with assessing their students ideas and helping them expand those ideas if they are weak, or not suitable for creating a project. Through this trial and error of finding a subject students will be able to find a subject that truly matters to them and will make them motivated to work. This trial and error will be key for the students success, as it will show how much they are willing to do in order to find a subject they can dig their teeth into and create something masterful. ",Rebuttal
that's not efficient or helpful to the students' education. ,Rebuttal
this problem can be solved by having each student have to get their project topic approved by a teacher first,Rebuttal
This way of thinking actually hurts students by putting excess stress on those who are less creative and providing creative students an unfair advantage,Rebuttal
but this leads to the fact that some students need unwavering structure to complete big assignments. Certain students can't handle being given the freedom to design their own summer projects. ,Rebuttal
"While it may be a valid concern that students might not complete the project to the exact standards of the teacher, it is still preferable for students to design their own projects.",Rebuttal
"Although this plagues kids all over the world, this could be avoided with limited teacher intervention just to the extent of helping the kids complete a well done project on time. ",Rebuttal
but the pros of teachers creating the project definitely outweigh the cons.,Rebuttal
They are wrong because no matter the difficulty of the project it will benenfit the student by getting their brain working during the summer,Rebuttal
Having a teacher design the project gives the teacher the ability to assure the student is learning what is expected of them.,Rebuttal
To avoid this scenario teachers could implement some sort of rubric or guidelines for what the student chosen project would have to include and how they will go about grading it. This way the playing field is level and everyone has the opportunity to succeed. ,Rebuttal
student- designed projects enhances their thinking and organizational skill.,Rebuttal
"But by having teachers design the projects themselves, it could interfere with your job or schedule leaving you stressed out over the summer when you should be more relaxed. It is always very important to make sure that you get rest mentally and physically. The teacher could also leave an assignment that you have no clue or interest in, resulting in you not learning as well on the project as you could have. Student designed summer assignments have the benefits for both the teacher and student. The student will learn and have fun while doing the project, and the teacher doesn't have to worry about people not turning it in because the students will be interested in their project that they personally designed. ",Rebuttal
Although what people with these beliefs fail to realize is that teachers are humans too and they get tired. Teachers wait for the summer to come just as much as students and to have them create an entirely new project towards the end of the year can be very tiring after having a year full of creating assignments. When the students create their own summer project it allows for teachers to be able to relax and take some weight off their shoulders as the day until summer slowing come. ,Rebuttal
"but this is in fact wrong. Teachers are one person and are not able to create strong bonds with every students they come across. Typically the project given is one standard made to fit everyone but thats not possible as everyone is not the same. This is why students should be allowed to create their own summer projects.
",Rebuttal
"Although students may be more passionate, the construction of the project will be less efficient and lack teacher expertise, which may lead to failures in the project's effectiveness. ",Rebuttal
Teachers need to stop categorizing all students and start looking at us one by one. Teachers should know each students strength one by one but they don't. ,Rebuttal
While this statement is true it is bias.,Rebuttal
but there is more value in a project that a student is able to choose.,Rebuttal
"However, it is clear that a self-designed project offers so much more.
",Rebuttal
" However, they are wrong because if the project was teacher-desiged, then the teacher would be able to choose the topic, leaving students with little to no freedom pn what to do.",Rebuttal
"However, a lot of them do not factor in the fact that it is not only their assignment the student has to worry about but multiple. ",Rebuttal
"This is problem has a simple, obvious solution: these will be student-designed, teacher-approved projects. To experience the benefits explained in the previous paragraphs, schools need not provide students with complete freedom, only a feeling of choice. Teachers will be able to keep students on track by guiding them toward project topics that will assist them in the next school year, and students still get to pursue a topic they're interested in.",Rebuttal
But students are just as capable as the teachers when it comes to helping out their peers and getting these summer projects done.,Rebuttal
"How ever they are wrong. Because students should be able to enjoy writing, and with the prompts the teacher gives out they just get stress out. Unquestibily, summer projects should be studenst desinged.",Rebuttal
"However, the problem with that being said, students will not know where to begin. Having no format or guidance will cause them to put any information down. Those information being unreliable sources; leading back to my first reason.",Rebuttal
"This fails to note that many teenagers already have things to do over the summer, and it would be a more of a bother to make them design a project themselves while also having it be on topic.",Rebuttal
"There is a limit to the freedom teachers should give students, but there should be extensive freedom to the students within guidelines. ",Rebuttal
"While this is a valid argument, with teacher designed projects, not all student's learning needs can be catered to. This is because every child has different strengths and weaknesses with different thought processes, especially having been away from school material for that period of time. Also, although teachers may have better structure and organization with their ideas having more experience, students need to develop those independent thinking and idea making skills for their higher education and overall knowledge. This said, teacher's should not be the ones to design summer project",Rebuttal
 allowing a teacher to issue the project would strike urgency and clarification for a student to complete this task.,Rebuttal
working with others can broaden ones perspective seems to outweighs those critics. ,Rebuttal
"however, the intention of challenging to stundents to be capable of critically thinking is seems to overpower the argument. ",Rebuttal
"However, this should not be the case because it compromises the whole point of summer assignments. If students were to create them, the content of the assignments would not be as helpful. Summer projects are not necessarily about being enjoyable. Their purpose is to ensure that students do not become to accustomed to doing nothing over the extensive period of wasted time called summer break. They keep students tethered to reality and are reminders that the beginning of school is nigh. They are helpful because they keep students' brains used to learning and working over the summer in order to make the start of the new year less painful. Teachers need to design the summer projects to ensure that the assignments retain their purpose and that they are helpful in keeping students busy over the summer. If a student designed them, they would not be as serious or helpful, and they would lose their purpose.
",Rebuttal
"Even though this allows for more freedom and creativity in summer projects, it doesn't help that many students are hesitant in starting their projects. The last thing many students want to do is their summer school work and adding the difficulty of having to make your own project will only stress students over their projects even more. Having a uniform project with guidelines designed by a teacher will be less stressful for the students to complete because they don't have to worry about coming up with their own project",Rebuttal
"Although I can see that point in which giving them instructions will be easier to grade and to show an understanding, it will also cause a lack of involvement and need to do it.",Rebuttal
" But facts are the facts, not every child can be trusted. And what hassle is it to have a teacher be in charge of designing when they already get paid to teach?",Rebuttal
"Although this rationale is reasonable, the goal of a summer project is to ensure that the student is learning about a topic they are interested in. A summer project is not to teach students any concepts; it is more so for them to take what they have learned and develop an application to it. By allowing students to find a topic that is best suited to their passions, they are given the freedom to extend their knowledge to the best of their ability and the encouragement to really engage in the learning process.",Rebuttal
but they are wrong.,Rebuttal
"however, that is not the case. If given the option, the teachers would assign a project that they think the students would enjoy. However, the teachers might not know exactly what interests the students and what the students find fun ",Rebuttal
"Their point is understandable, but most students want to enjoy their summer break not work on projects; they will try to reduce the amount of work that needs to be done , therefore not cover all the materials that could have been covered. This is a very costly decision, because the students might end up with a lot of work to do when they get back to class and result in a wastage of valuable time they could have used learning new lessons. therefore leaving the project designing to the teacher is the more sensible decision.",Rebuttal
"Although they know the material better, the students summer break is their time and when giving them an assignment, It should be their choice on how they want to complete it.",Rebuttal
" Teachers can't trust that all students are like that though because each kid is different and most likely, when given the chance, the student will take the day to go to the pool rather than sit at home and do their own research about Stem Cell research. ",Rebuttal
students are more likely to have the time and motivation to complete them than if a teacher had designed them. ,Rebuttal
"However, both teacher-designed and student-designed projects open up the possibility of lazy work. Teacher-designed projects will inevitably suffer from lazy work while student-designed projects can suffer from lazy design. Either way, students will find ways to work less over their break ",Rebuttal
" but at the end of the day, summer is supposed to be a time off from instructional learning.",Rebuttal
All of these reasons still do not make up for the endless opportunities that kids would have if the summer projects were student-designed.,Rebuttal
This isn't a bad thing but it tends to happen. Overall students want to have fun with learning. It's already boring enough to do homework so cut the students some slack.,Rebuttal
How ever that can be proved false. ,Rebuttal
But if they can chose something they was always interested in and just never to the time to do research on it. Also if they do chose something they already know about but if they chose to work as a group they can learn something new from their peer. Even if it is something they already know about you can always learn something new. The teacher can also give certain guide lines on what they choose or they can give them options. ,Rebuttal
"If the student believes that the designated work is too hard, or maybe too easy, then they should talk to their teacher and suggest a different topic. Also, if the students thinks that there is another area they need to practice more, they should ask their teacher to consider their request. ",Rebuttal
"While this may be true, if every student has a different project design, then it will be very difficult for teachers to grade. If the teacher designs the project then the teacher can create a rubric to easily make sure that the student actually learned over the summer.",Rebuttal
"Although, the teacher is responsible for teaching the class, the student is responsible for knowing which areas they need improvement on. Every student is different, one student may find challenging, another may find it easy. For example, in my geometry class, most students find proportions simple, whereas I find them rather complex and challenging. If I were to design my own summer assignment for geometry, I would include a lot of proportions to ensure I get the needed practice. This is just one of the example of how students know where they need improvement and how a student can help promote their own success. ",Rebuttal
"However, even if the students fail at this task they will learn from the failure. They learn what they did wrong in order to develop more skills and when the next opportunity comes they will not fail. Either way fail or succeed the students learn different types of independent life skills that are very valuable and needed for adult life.",Rebuttal
"However, the decrease in the amount of problems and page length will only urge students to complete the packet instead of copying.
",Rebuttal
"However, because of age gaps and other variables many teacher do not know what students find entertaining.",Rebuttal
"However, students know what they struggled with more than the teachers; therefore, they know what to put in the packet to avoid struggle for future students. ",Rebuttal
"but the way for students to understand said subject is through practice, planning, and research of the topics.",Rebuttal
"I say that we give students the opportunity to be students and live their life as teens as much as they possibly can before they jump right into the real world. I believe that students should design their projects, but the teachers should approve.",Rebuttal
but they are wrong because if students do a student version then they will be more happy about the project and they will be less stressed over their summer break.,Rebuttal
"The students are more creative than the teachers, but the teachers are more organized than the students. The teachers can lay out the requirements and what they would want to see in the kids projects, but the students would think thats boring and not interesting. Even though, the teachers can do a better organization and lay of the project, the students would think that it would not be interesting enough. Having the students design their projects would be great!",Rebuttal
" this is false. Students learn best when they are able to connect their own ideas to the curriculum, explore the curriculum by themselves, and conduct self-learning, all of which are only possible via student designed summer projects.",Rebuttal
 Nothing bad is going to happen.,Rebuttal
I do think that sometimes it can be dangerous ,Rebuttal
On the ship you have jobs and on the return trips you can play games in the stalls where the animails where hosted.,Rebuttal
This would be a great oppertunity for anyone who loves farming evan if you don't you could learn a great lesson from this Seagoing Cowboy program.,Rebuttal
but I say he did a heroic act by bring cattle and horses to war torn countries,Rebuttal
But other than that you will have a great time with the crew ,Rebuttal
"But, the good guys can help the americans win the war. ",Rebuttal
" But, if you do you can go to places you never been to before. ",Rebuttal
"But, if you do, you can expericance some wild action on your adventure. ",Rebuttal
but it is so worth it ,Rebuttal
But really we have enough cattle in places like America. ,Rebuttal
the countries\cities are fascinating. I think you could see them again.,Rebuttal
"However, in the text it states that the cowboys play basketball and volleyball. The text aslo states that they would have table tennis tournaments, boxing, fencing, reading, and they would play games. These details prove that maybe you'll have fun being a Seagoing Cowboy. ",Rebuttal
" However, Luke said that it was a once in a lifetime expirience ",Rebuttal
"However, in the text it states that it helped people who lived in Eurpoe and China. Also, in the text it states that it made people more aware of other people in other countries. These details prove that you could help a lot of people in need.",Rebuttal
Well you are right sorry but it is worth it. I get sea sick. Then sty in the bottom of the ship. Idon't like fish. aThen do not look at them ovily. I have probles or isuse. Then stop with alllll the complaining. ,Rebuttal
but you could get sea sick or worse home sick. If you get home sick you may not know what to do. ,Rebuttal
but think about it. ,Rebuttal
but you get to do a lot of fun things to ,Rebuttal
 but it is still great.,Rebuttal
but can be something incredible as well ,Rebuttal
"
The trip is much more than just any adernarry trip the trip will open up the world to you or any person that might go on this wonder full trip to go see what the sea looks like. ",Rebuttal
but they are wrong,Rebuttal
"but thats not true, sometimes we get a chance to look at the beutiful views and feature take, thats always a plesure!",Rebuttal
"but I disagree. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is nothing like a normal, boring life. Yes, you have hard work, but you get the greatest sense of satisfaction once you're done. You get to know that all your hard work has gone to helping people in need, and that you've really made a mark on this world. I think hard work is also the path to knowledge, and you may just learn some life lessons along the way.",Rebuttal
"but in reality, it's quite the contrary. If you're a Seagoing Cowboy, you get to travel the world, like I mentioned. You can see places like Greece, Italy, and China. Also, don't forget their unforgetable landmarks that you will see!",Rebuttal
"This may be so, but would you rather be taking lives, or saving them? Plus, us Seagoing Cowboys were only created because of World War II to clean up the mess. Wouldn't it be counterproductive to start a World War III? ",Rebuttal
but you can visualize the importance of why you need to help those citizens who have lost so much ,Rebuttal
"the time goes by fast while playing fun and relaxing games such as:fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and tennis tournaments ",Rebuttal
"It might be possible that they are just scared to travel to an unknown place, but, being a seagoing cowboy allows the cowboys to only take one trip to help others, have fun, and see the world. It won't take very long at all! ",Rebuttal
" Luke felt that these were things that he needed to do and is something that is important to him.
",Rebuttal
 Well once again that is their opinion and Luke was happy the way that he went and was happy that he could see it and that he go to experience the jouney.,Rebuttal
"The people who say that are very wrong, Seagoing Cowboys have a lot of fun on their spare time. When we finish our orders we take some time off and do fun activites. In Venice, Italy, I took a gondala ride over a city with streets of water. In China I also toured an excavated castle, and marveled at the Panama Canal. Another way we have fun is on board. When the ships have been unloaded we play baseball games, vollyball games, fenceing, boxing, and many other fun things to help pass time.",Rebuttal
the job and traveling kept me very busy and aware of what life was like. ,Rebuttal
"but it sure is a lot of fun, seeing and learning things from all over the world.
",Rebuttal
but if you were to join up with the sea going cowboys than you could sea all those things.,Rebuttal
but he is still alive.,Rebuttal
"but you have alot of fun, and you will get awarded those long ride by seing something you have never seen like the excavated castle, China, and Europe. ",Rebuttal
But it is all for a good cause to save outher peoples lives. ,Rebuttal
" Well, with the technologhy we have today you won't be as likely to slip and fall out of the boat. ",Rebuttal
"You would be able to protect the animals and you because the U.S. wouldn't send you without any protection. You would most likely have guns or othe ships following you. Also, most likely no one will attack you while you are trying to get animals or help a country. ",Rebuttal
" It would be really fun if you wanted to be a cowboy or cowgirl, and liked animals",Rebuttal
but it's really not. ,Rebuttal
you get to have fun with the other cowboys.,Rebuttal
"But it is not all fun and games so if you like hard word you would love the job of being a Seagoing Cowboy,",Rebuttal
these people dont know the good it will do thecountry. And the people who really need help. they dont want to help out other people.,Rebuttal
well they're wrong ,Rebuttal
Well I say they're not wasted!,Rebuttal
but I bet you can fight through it like Luke and Don did,Rebuttal
"but it would be worth it. Its fun to explore and see new places so enjoy the opportunity while it lasts or just say yes and start your .

journey",Rebuttal
"but you should know it will be fun tho care for these animals, they are very gentle loving creatures.
",Rebuttal
 if they do go then they would have a great opportunity to experience what it is like to do new things that they have never done before.,Rebuttal
Luke continued to go on his adventure and still found ways to have fun like said in paragraph 8 ,Rebuttal
"but you'll get the hang of it. After all that, just think of how good you'll feel after knowing you've helped people.",Rebuttal
"No, there is so much more to see everywhere else in the world than what is to be seen here, in America.",Rebuttal
"First of all, there is absolutely no way that you will get killed on the ship, and second, there is about a fourteen million to one chance that the ship will sink, because our captain is the best in the world. ",Rebuttal
"I don't think that is a very good reason to ot go, because one, you will get over it and two, the only reason anyone ever threw up on the ship is because he was watching The Exorcist an eating clam chowder.",Rebuttal
",but, when your heading back home you can use the empty space that you put the supplies in for fun activities",Rebuttal
" I believe that it is worth it, and I would know.",Rebuttal
The lucky thing about being on a ship for that long is that I had my friends onbord and I was having a good time.,Rebuttal
"Well , it is worth the time because you get to see amazing sights , and meet amazing people and animals . Yes , you will have to leave home but just think of all the stories you will have to tell . If people say you will not get anything out of joining the Seagoing Cowboy program , tell them you will see many sights , have alot of fun , and meet new people . So you do get something out of being in this program . ",Rebuttal
 but they should know that joining this can be very helpful to people around the world.,Rebuttal
"It took a while to get there, but it was worth it! I got to explore unique places and unbelievable sights. Working there keeps you busy, but you get to work with great people and the jobs are usually fun even if they sound boring. ",Rebuttal
"When my friend told me that it would be a neat adventure, I got excited, but it was way more than that, we rode in on a cattle-boat, so we got to explore the Panama Canal and much more!",Rebuttal
"However, there are many more good things than bad thisng during this job it is hard but you get to help others whle putting yourself in danger. ",Rebuttal
"If you take this job, then you will be considered a hard working and caring person. This job is like no other. Jobs like these aren't offered all the time. It makes you more aware of countries and their needs. Not only countries, this job makes you more aware of the world we live in today.    ",Rebuttal
I don't like to see our allies in war whille we stayed and watched. ,Rebuttal
"there still is hard things you have to do. But, once you get past that it will be fine.",Rebuttal
"but, boy are you wrong ",Rebuttal
it could be the best experiance for the right people,Rebuttal
"But by the end its all worth is, im sure luke felt good about himself once the job was finished and done. Touring around different citys, helping feed animals. Its amazing and something new and those are just some of the reasons why you should join the program and if you do good luck and have fun seeing different parts of the world",Rebuttal
But when you get to see abunch of special stuff it is like all of the hard and dangours worck wasn't even that hard.,Rebuttal
It is still a fun job because,Rebuttal
"Well, there not completly wrong.
",Rebuttal
but you'll be fine.,Rebuttal
it is definitly worth the trip.,Rebuttal
"In the end though, it pays off. ",Rebuttal
 but many countries and people are helped.,Rebuttal
When the job is over you get to play games on your way home. Right when you get back you dont have to get more animals and go straight back to the job. If you want you can spend time with your family and chill out.,Rebuttal
t is worth it to see the animals get safely to their destination. You can join knowing that you will be making big differences in millions of creatures' lives.,Rebuttal
",but it is so worth it once you get on and go on the journey. ",Rebuttal
"What the people that say this don't see is that the organization pays for most of the cost. Sometimes I bet you that the people that go on this trip don't even spend a dime or a penny.
",Rebuttal
"So, why not bring them with you i'm pretty sure we would have more then enough things for you children to do. Remeber this is a very serious and dangerous job . I've gotten through a only one bad injury where I broke a rib .(paragraph7). That will be very unlikely to happen though considering none of my parteners have ever had that happen to them.
",Rebuttal
" Luke had just said but it's a lifetime chance to go to all of those places and it would really make you happy but, if you don't want to go then just don't go. then that person named Joe said he wanted to go and that was Lukes best friend and Luke knew that they were going to have fun.",Rebuttal
"Everyone gets physically in their lifetime.
",Rebuttal
"They could go to Fiji,Thailand and just work work with animals and play games,do every fun thing that a kid is supposed to do while their still young.",Rebuttal
"We'll put your wallets away because guess what, the seagoing cowboy program is absolutely free. You don't have to pay not a dime out of your wallet. ",Rebuttal
"but what's better: watching you favorite Tv show or helping poor animals recover from World War ll ?
",Rebuttal
hey its worth the wait to help the sick ,Rebuttal
 think about all the people you could save.,Rebuttal
"so you got to be careful with making decisions, and acting properly at the places we go ",Rebuttal
"""Well do you like being on boats?""

I have never been on a boat."" said the guy ""you should take the job the because there are so many things you get to see and if you have never been on a boat befor e it would be fun i love doing it."" I say.",Rebuttal
"But that's exactly how they should remain:

extracurricular.

As in, outside of the required learning and entirely optional.",Rebuttal
"Well, usually, students take a long time to do their homework because they do not want to. They want to have fun! Everyone wants to have fun, nobody wants to be stuck at a desk doing homework. Extracurricular activities are fun and do not take up a massive amount of time. Students will still have time to do their homework after having some fun doing what they love",Rebuttal
"Although you might get hurt, it does not happen very often. Not all extracurricular activities give the oppritunities to get hurt, but they all give the oppritunity to have fun! ",Rebuttal
"Maybe if they were forced to choose one activity, they would find a passion in that activity that they didn't know that they had ",Rebuttal
while others think it's a great idea. ,Rebuttal
the voices of the people who finds extracurricular activities hard and time consuming is important and should be heard too,Rebuttal
"but as someone who gets a lot of homework, and knows that everyone else gets that crazy amount of homework to, it would probably just stress them out even more then they already are. ",Rebuttal
"Even though playing a sport is bad for some students, they can still play.",Rebuttal
"While that might be true, students who are required to participate in at least one extracurricular do have a choice in what club or clubs they join. That choice is explained well by Dr. Matthew Brown, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington State who said, ""even when students are required to participate in something -- either a class or an activity -- they still always have some sort of choice, whether that is what activity to do or what mindset to have."" Using both sets of logic previously stated, when the students choose what club to participate in, they will experience the largest amount of positive results.
",Rebuttal
"On the other hand, the activity does not have to be very long nor everyday and it could even be during school at the end of the day. For example, Timmy Lung from the Board of Supervisors argues ""When people thing about activities they think after school, but that is not the case. Activities can be during any time of the school day."" I agree with that, when we do Clubs at BRMS we do them at the end of the day. That way kids can go home and go and do homework and have time for their other sport. I know that if we had extracurricular activities after school then it would be hard for me because I have other sports to do and lots of homework on top of that.
",Rebuttal
"While that may be true, we can't help the people that will break out of their shell if we just look at the minority. Gary Smith, A Professor of psychology claimed the following, ""while there may be others that refuse to participate, we can't eliminate the rule completely, doing so could lead to the students growing up with social problems, such as depression, or suicidal thoughts,"". Looking at this, it shows that we are still helping people break free, and really live their lives, the others may just need more help with meeting new people. Everyone can do it, it just might take more time for others.",Rebuttal
having them be required to do such a thing i think is good.,Rebuttal
" The easy solution to this problem is that schools most likely have at least one after-school club that seems appealing for that child, which is very convenient because your child is at school anyways, so being dropped off is not necessary. Also, if your specific sport or club is not offered at your school, there is a very high chance that someone else does the same activity, and you can carpool together ",Rebuttal
"Because of this argument, many clubs allow you to complete your homework during their session time, or are only about an hour long, still giving you time to finish your homework at home.",Rebuttal
"some sports can be pricey, most school activities just have a small registration fee. Some clubs are even free! ",Rebuttal
but is it good for the staff. I think the janaders work here longer then anybody. And they do there best to clean the school. I think if work here that long I think they should get paid more. They don't leave the school until every thing is clean. ,Rebuttal
"This actually makes sense, except that they should be required to do it. ",Rebuttal
This however is not true for Generic_School students. ,Rebuttal
However this is true but let me tell you why this isnt the case for all students.,Rebuttal
"I strongly disagree with that statement. I am a student, and a majority of my peers take part in many other activities, such as sports, musical instruments, plays, and any other things along those lines, that wouldn't allow them to have any spare time to do another activity.",Rebuttal
it isn't fair to the students who do not want to be apart of any activities,Rebuttal
But the other student they dont like to do any of that but they are being focus to do stuff. ,Rebuttal
It should be an optional activity to attend not mandatory.,Rebuttal
"Those that are socially akward, can create a club and learn how to talk to poeple so they can make friends.",Rebuttal
some people will disagree ,Rebuttal
"However, they should be joined on one's own terms.
",Rebuttal
"There wrong because although schools are for learning new concepts in math,science, civics and more doesnt mean students should not have the opportunity to join a yearbook staff or a sports team. ",Rebuttal
The only way that participating in an extracurricular activity could be a waste of time is if you aren't managing your time efficiently. ,Rebuttal
 I don't disagree with this but that's just one bad reason out of many good reasons.,Rebuttal
" No, even if the student makes more friends some of those other students are not the best people to be around.",Rebuttal
but a lot of the time i have important things to get done at home.,Rebuttal
Well Generic_School has late buses and have a homework club. With Generic_School's Generic_Name stay after you can also stay after school with a teacher then once you finished with the teacher you have the option to go to a club. Many clubs come with different benefits. Something like Game Room comes with the benefit of making new friends. Game Room also has the benefit of doing homework and learning new skills. Even if there are obstacles you can always make it to after school since Generic_School makes it so easy. ,Rebuttal
"However, students can still participate in extracurricular activities and have time after school for things such as homework and chores. ",Rebuttal
 But what if those student were planing on seeing their friends. ,Rebuttal
We have no idea of what their home life is like.,Rebuttal
"However, other people who participate in extracurricular activities get their work done on time which means that there are ways to do so. ",Rebuttal
"However, there is such a wide variety of things to do at most schools that there is something everyone can enjoy. ",Rebuttal
 but it can also mean taking time away from other things in order to include something else. ,Rebuttal
"No, Ive gone to a variety of after school activities and not ne new thing I've tried I stuck with, shocker. ",Rebuttal
but it can be. Being lonely does not last that long before a fellow students notices the student and decides to go and talk to him or her and before they know it they became friends.,Rebuttal
at the end of whatever you are doing you will be happy you did. ,Rebuttal
You will most likely find on you enjoy.,Rebuttal
"I believe that at least one extracurricular class would help students a lot.
",Rebuttal
"I agree that is what after school activities are suppose to be like but some people don't like the idea of staying at school any longer then they already do. Another thing is that what if you choose a activity but it is already full so you are auto assigned to a activity you don't like. Some people might just quit the activity and find one they like outside of school, but you have to stay in your assigned group because it is mandatory. ",Rebuttal
 it is not a waste of time and money,Rebuttal
"However, the activities are not meant for the parents. They are meant for the students. Going back to the first survey mentioned; the one given to Generic_City students; out of 2243 responses, 96% of students say their activities are worth while. Almost every single student thought their activities were worth their time. If students believe their activities don't take up too much time, why not require them? If their parents are unhappy that should not change anything because these activities are meant to benefit students, not their parents.",Rebuttal
"However, this can be a good thing. ",Rebuttal
"However, what they don't think about is how extracurricular activities can affect them positively!",Rebuttal
" Although this only works for some students that's why it should be voluntarily. Because, for example, Some students could be very stressed out with school and need a break and that's what they use their after-school time for. So it's not good for the school to come and interrupt their daily schedules. There are also plenty of various problems students face like being bullied or having mental issues, so the best place for them would be home. Many students also have busy schedules and schools want to interfere with it. ",Rebuttal
our county administrators might fail to see the real outcome of this decision. ,Rebuttal
it benefits the majority of people. ,Rebuttal
A good solution to these issues is to have it discussed with a guidance counselor to find a way to fix these problems. ,Rebuttal
but they are wrong.,Rebuttal
"but look on the bright side; you get out of class, dont have to do work, and you get to socialize with your friends our other people you dont know, try to make new friends",Rebuttal
that's not going to get you nowhere in life.,Rebuttal
"well this is true for everyone and my response to that islet them dig there own path let them take life how they want if they just want to relax the entire time let them do that. Let them control there life let them enjoy it. If you want to take life one step at a time go head be you. Dont let some one tell you your to lazy.
",Rebuttal
but there are a lot more negatives I see from this decision than positives.,Rebuttal
"There is a wide variety of activities that can fit any persons interests, whether they enjoy chess or track and field ",Rebuttal
"Being social teaches you great life skills for the future. You can't avoid not talking to people the rest of your life because you have to eventually get somewhere financially or even physically. Last but not least, I think social skills are the most important things you have to learn if you want to do an after school club, because you cannot enjoy it if you don't talk to anyone.",Rebuttal
"While that might be true, there's no denying that after school activities can also teach kids to lessen their stress by learning to budget their time ",Rebuttal
"I think that an extra curricular activity is fun and may or may not get you famous,but on the other hand people just seem to abuse it's power. ",Rebuttal
but sometimes you just gotta try what's new,Rebuttal
But all of these reasons are just part of life ,Rebuttal
It isn't all about the changes or the service it also helps them come together as a community and accomplish things as a team,Rebuttal
"But, in reality extracurricular activities are the reason some students come to school and strive to do their best.",Rebuttal
"But, the experiences that they bring students are worth more than a million dollars. ",Rebuttal
"Even with all of that though, in the long run, this rule will pay off.",Rebuttal
just because it is pushed for does not mean it should be mandatory.,Rebuttal
"In my opinion, participating in one extracurricular activity is termenously and entertainment for students.",Rebuttal
not all students are capable of handling the responsibilities that come along with an extracurricular activity.,Rebuttal
this decision made by the school can give students the chance to work on their time management.,Rebuttal
"If we don't like the activity though, some problems might appear",Rebuttal
"but it's okay, it takes time to get used to people you dont know, so joining clubs and making new friends can help you be more social and find it easier to get along with others. ",Rebuttal
"I don't think that making someone sign up for an activity is a good idea because they won't have fun. However, it's always good to try something new. If they don't like the activity they signed up for, then they don't have to do it next time. Try something else. Activities are supposed to be a fun, enjoyable time. ",Rebuttal
there are academical purposes for these activities you could learn a language or take a extra class to get help with math. It is all up to what you want to do with that extra class. Spending six hours of your day sitting and doing work only to get a break to eat is not good for you. If changing that means you waste a half a hour to just run around or talk then so be it. ,Rebuttal
Then there is a place for you because there are clubs that are just older or younger kids. ,Rebuttal
although its going to help you in the future in many ways .,Rebuttal
"This means that when students participate in activities with others, they are actually happier and mentally healthier. ",Rebuttal
but not more important than family or work needs.,Rebuttal
 But student will need this when they have nothing else to do or when they have bad grades and they need help. ,Rebuttal
it is still important to give them the experiences they need to become vulnerable to success. ,Rebuttal
 But if you learn how to time manage everything that needs to be done then you should be okay.,Rebuttal
"However, classes can be adjusted so students have time for the activity if that is really the case. In most cases, students need better time management.",Rebuttal
I believe that their are a lot more positive effects if students participate in an extracurricular activity ,Rebuttal
"So the school fills that gap from the cliff stopping that student from participating offering many activities that do not require a fee or any sort of paying. And if they do the school can fill that gap with the extra money they have, you can even donate to the school so the school can keep providing their students with the money they need in order to sign up. ",Rebuttal
"In the result of that the school makes the study halls or resources longer so you have time to finish your homework, essay, or school project. This will take the stress off of the students and let them sleep for a healthy amount of time instead of staying up late trying to finish that project. ",Rebuttal
other students might not to do the things that u want to them to do like i never seen a student that wanna work for the council and this is the reason i think this is a bad idea,Rebuttal
but others should not be forced to.,Rebuttal
"While that is a busy schedule, that person is forgetting about Tuesday and Thursday. What if they wanted if off? Well, think about it. Does it seem like these after-school things take up much time? Not at all! In fact, most of them only take up an hour of your day. ",Rebuttal
"But in reality, it very much does not. The country with the best education system does not force work onto students by putting down homework on their backs. They instead, educate them in a fun and memorable way.",Rebuttal
but other students may not be as positively impacted in the same way as others.,Rebuttal
"However, this is just not the case for most students because students can determine what an activity would be like with the given information. ",Rebuttal
That is false due to the fact that students may not be able to change to time for their other activities and they might only to be able to see their family and friends at certain times. ,Rebuttal
"This is not the case because students would not get a benefit from being forced, it would be the opposite. ",Rebuttal
"Although some students say they get stressed from more extracurricular activities, most kids already participate in one. In an article by Generic_Name, she states, ""5 out students 6 say they already participate in sports. A student from Generic_School, Generic_Name, even says, 'I play 4 sports and I have never been stressed. Playing 4 sports actually makes me feel less stressed.'"" Generic_Name is saying that most kids play sports to relax them.",Rebuttal
those who do not are wasting their time by doing an activity they may not enjoy. ,Rebuttal
"But in one thing some not all students some hood really stay after like the ones that can't speak english, or the ones who need help on writing on english,or the ones who really need help to read on english . ",Rebuttal
but based off all the information I have this is a terrible idea and no student would be happy especially the parents ,Rebuttal
"However, many of the students that already to extracurricular activities are active in multiple clubs. These students still manage to get their work done. ",Rebuttal
"but that's not the question,the question was do I agree with it? No I don't.",Rebuttal
It should be their choice and their choice only. Not the principal's who has no idea what a student's life is like after the last bell rings.,Rebuttal
This may be true but I would imagine you have over one hundred students or even with just one hunded students you would be pushing the limit of how many students one techer can watch not to mention the teacher dose not get paid to watch students after school. They may also have children of their own they need to take care of.,Rebuttal
I would agree but students could very well dislike being told to do an activity and if they dislike it alredy it will not end well. ,Rebuttal
"but the choice of if students should be forced to have to participate in an extracurricular activity should not be made by them.
",Rebuttal
but they are wrong. They are wrong because if you play a sport and have practice after school is normally no more than an hour and a half. Lets say you got out of school at 3:30 and went to bed at 10:00 then you would still have 4 to 5 hours to study or do homework.,Rebuttal
"Some things you could do to help this is do you school work in the car since you are not home for most of they day and could be driving for a while, or find something that is closer to home.",Rebuttal
"To test that, a group of William and Mary University students went to 3 different middle schools and asked every 8th grade student whether or not they would like participation in extracurricular activities to be mandatory. Afterwards, they took the 152 students who said no due to not wanting to have to participate in an extracurricular activity and asked them to join an extracurricular program of their choosing for one week. After the week, every single student who said that they did not want to participate in an extracurricular activity changed their minds.",Rebuttal
Even though kids should already be doing activities or sports. A lot of kids will just sit around and watch Netflix after school. ,Rebuttal
the actually commitment would minimally affect the amount of time spent on school work. The commitment for some activities could be as little as 1 or 2 hours a week and students can decide what kind of commitment they want to make.,Rebuttal
But that problem can be easily fixed because there are several clubs and teams that meet once a week or even meet on the weekend. ,Rebuttal
But that problem can also be fixed easily because there are several free clubs available to students. ,Rebuttal
 but all parents are different and some may not want their kid to do that. ,Rebuttal
 but they just don't see the many benefits that you would get.,Rebuttal
"Yes, students have homework to do, so we can have each club have a specific day of the week to prevent students from staying after everyday ",Rebuttal
Then in that case the school will provide transportation from the school to the students bus stop ,Rebuttal
"If your having difficulties with time, its important to communicate with your parents, I am sure they can figure something out. ",Rebuttal
but like i said before in the begin of my talk. i dont fully agree even though this will help the students.,Rebuttal
"Yes this is something that could be an issue, but if the teachers in charge of the clubs gave out consequences for students who continued to skip every meeting without an excused absence, than this will work.",Rebuttal
they do not help all,Rebuttal
"but many young teenagers dont know how much they love something untill they try it, this rule would push kids that usually sit inside all day to try new things. ",Rebuttal
BUt if they do only stuff they like say they major in it and the career doesnt work out what do they have to bounce back on? You wanna always have something to bounce back on but it wont be easy thats why you want to try new things ,Rebuttal
 But i think not all of the students should have to stay after school because it just is not fair for all of the students to have to stay after school.,Rebuttal
"On the other hand, if they are not determined their efforts will go to waste. If you force extra curricular activities then students' other efforts could go to waste.",Rebuttal
but you at some point in life you need to expand your territory and meet new people.,Rebuttal
but I think staying in shape and making friends is more important.,Rebuttal
"However, this is not always the case.",Rebuttal
"You can tell them that not all after school activities are sports related, and so instead of making your kids play sports try letting them pick what they want to do. There are so many good clubs and organizations to join in school so why not take advantage of it? For example you could join the yearbook committee or join student council, there are so many options we could keep going forever. Now what if your child does not like any of the extracurricular activities? Schools are great places to try new things, just because your child has never done something before does not mean they won't necessarily like it. So before you jump the gun and say you child does not like something maybe let them explore their options first.",Rebuttal
"I'm not saying they shouldn't, I'm just saying it could cause problems for less fortunate families.",Rebuttal
"I think this is a good argument but, some kids could still find it not enjoyable. Say they wanted to do on activity but it filled up so they got placed into something they didn't want to do. That person probably won't have as much fun as they would have had in the one they wanted to do. ",Rebuttal
but half of extracurricular activities won't aid students in finding a career. Most extracurricular activities will only teach students what they need to know if they want to be a teacher or sponsor for that same extracurricular activity when it is time for the students to get a job.,Rebuttal
Sports are fun but not everyone loves the fact of working out.,Rebuttal
but life isnt always your choice.,Rebuttal
"but why should they be forced to take one?
",Rebuttal
I personally think its a great idea but some people dont have the time or energy to do it. Its mainly meant so that everyone knows each other and that the students and teachers or students and staff memebers would be closer as well.,Rebuttal
"us students would like to have some time to go home ad relax, or hang out with friends, before having to go to whatever sport or activity we have going on outside of school. If we had to participate in extracurriculars, some of us just would not have enough time to go home and relax our brains!
",Rebuttal
"but only if you have your schoolwork and projects together. But again, if you're flustered it doesn't sound and probably won't be fun to participate in.",Rebuttal
but what they dont see is that Mr. Generic_Name is creating new opertuntiy for you and setting you up for life .,Rebuttal
" To that I say no. Many students do have nothing on their schedule, but that is okay. School is stressful and maybe these students just want to relax with their free time. If that is what they want to do then I think they should be able to do that. ",Rebuttal
however requiring extracurricular activities can help a lot more people improve their skills and making new friends. ,Rebuttal
 it could also make them feel that they don't fit in of they are forced to do something that they don't want to do. If the principal forces students to join a sports team or any other thing like yearbook club they might not like it and because they are forced to do it they might start to lose respect for the principal and the other staff at the school. All in all I think that students shouldn't be forced to join and extracurricular activity if they don't want too became they could start to feel pressured to do good and practice a lot for it and fall behind in school.,Rebuttal
forcing them to take an extracurricular activity is not the way to help them to be better people and to teach them how to work together as a team. If you force them they will not know eachother and won't work that well as a team. ,Rebuttal
"Well, i'm sure there is something they would enjoy, because there are many options ",Rebuttal
" I only have one thing to say to that, which is: Maybe, if they don't want to support you in your point, why are you doing it. Theres most definitely something wrong with your idea if the government won't help you.",Rebuttal
"While some students are social butterflies, other choose to have a more reserved life style or are active in their own ways. ",Rebuttal
That is why one activity is enough to start. ,Rebuttal
But kids with to much freedom get lazy and distracted.,Rebuttal
but if some one wants to do an activity or play sports they can do it on there own they dont have to be forced for that stuff if you want to do it you will do it if you dont you shouldn't be forced that just going to make the students mad and aggressive ,Rebuttal
 but you also have to look and see what could happen like kids being late to class or kids coming to school late because of how late they home or kids falling asleep in class or kids grades dropping. There is so many defects to this where all the positive things don't really matter cause of all the negative things. ,Rebuttal
"You dont have to do something if you dont like it, but it is always good to try something new. ",Rebuttal
"However, picking out a activity can exactly be easy because its something that you enjoy doing on a daily bases. ",Rebuttal
 but there are more benefits to it.,Rebuttal
Then they can go and talk to the principal and see if they can add a new activity. But if not then they donÃÂ´t have to do it. ,Rebuttal
"Now while that may be true some parents sometimes push there kids into taking those after school activities, and thats always a bad thing because, I think that the parents should respect there kids opinion about doing an after school activity. I also know, I know, I don't want my mom screaming at me telling me what I can, or can't do. ",Rebuttal
 but soon enough you could be meeting your closest friends.,Rebuttal
"but the students should have freedom over what they do. At least, if anything, contact the students' parents and ask them for approval. Don't just force them to, though, because it's not right to force students to participate in any activities that they aren't interested in doing. With this, I believe that the students should have the freedom to choose and not have to participate in any activity if they aren't intrigued.",Rebuttal
 But that does not mean we cant explore and gain new information about the planet that mey help us out in the future,Rebuttal
NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus.,Rebuttal
but if you would want to find out more about venus then that's the option.,Rebuttal
The author does not tell us what the insight is that will be gained from exploring the planet. Also what does human curiosity leading us into other endeavors have to do with how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Their reason and support for studying Venus is weak. The author trys to use their own opinion to convince the readers that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit.,Rebuttal
A problem to this could be that the metal might actually not work on Venus because since no one has ever been ther how would they know exactly what it is going to be like. That is why they are going there in the first place to explore Venus ,Rebuttal
"The pros of this mission are far less important than the cons to this mission. If they succed then they can say they know what on Venus and can gain some information. If they fail then people can die, a load of money is gone because of the time, energy, and resorces put into the exploration are gone. ",Rebuttal
That is no excuse. The mission to land on Venus is a challenge at hand but it can be survived by humans. ,Rebuttal
 it can still perhaps show how he supports it by giving details.,Rebuttal
"it is stated that instead of feeling like there is a risk to you, think of them as challenges that you will one day overcome.",Rebuttal
"On the other hand, I still think it would be a good idea to keep studying more about Venus. But to keep people safe, they should invent things that they can use so they can land on Venus without any danger",Rebuttal
but when it comes to saving the human race I think it's a risk worth taking. There are a couple things that the Earth and Venus have in common,Rebuttal
"but we might have solutions for them. When is comes to the human race and having a plan B, I think this is something to consider. ",Rebuttal
"human curiosity can always over power the dangerous,",Rebuttal
" However, the article says that this can only give us a limited amount of information on Venus since the planet has a very dense atmosphere. The effort of creating a vehicle to hover the planet only to gain bits of knowledge is redundant and is not going the benefit anyone´s cause.
",Rebuttal
"well its because a long time ago scientist think that venus used to be like earth just with alot more water butit was capable to form life there. venus still has some features similer to ones on earth like a surface of rocky sediments and valleys, mountains, and craters. ",Rebuttal
The author could have done more to support the idea that Venus is worth studying. They gave three pieces of supporting evidence on why it was worth studying and did not go on to further explain why these three examples made Venus worth studying. ,Rebuttal
"but lacked a further explanation as to why. There were good ideas brought to the table about why Venus would be worth the dangers of the exploration. However, the author briefly mentioned them in one paragraph and did not elaborate on their reasons. ",Rebuttal
"I ask the writer of this, what useful insight is there to be gained by this endeavor. I also think why focus Venus instead of mars, which in comparison is much more accepting host of humans.",Rebuttal
Even if we did that we couldn't take sample rocks or gas ,Rebuttal
"Even if we do that though, what would be the sense if we cant even live on the planet. Half of the stuff we use today will never outstand the heat or pressure that Venus has. Including phones,cars,and houses.",Rebuttal
but the conditions seem to risky and how are they 100% shore about these thiges anyway. In the artical it states ,Rebuttal
They believe that we should explore Venus.,Rebuttal
"but the author needed to support his claim with other information, other than strictly in this paragraph.
",Rebuttal
" NASA has proposed an idea of basically hovering thirty miles above the surface in order to avoid the harsh conditons of the atmosphere. The upside, it would be a moree safe alternative. The downside, Astronauts would be unable to collect samples from the surface of Venus, which brings up a whole new concept of being ""scientifically productive."" ",Rebuttal
venus is the most fit planet to live on besides the earth and we could servive on venous.,Rebuttal
This is a risk that should be takes becuase if not there is a chance we could missout on a discover that could do big things.,Rebuttal
they claim that studying the Earth-like planet is worth it.,Rebuttal
but he elaborates more on the reasons pointing to the dangers that Venus poses. ,Rebuttal
"Although these conditions would be harsh, humans could survive with the correct equipment and strong motivation. Just like during any new accomplishments, you have to be patient. Nothing will come to you if you try to rush the process, but if you are patiently waiting and working hard, it could lead to a greater impact. Technological advancments will also play an unbeliveably large part it what makes this possible. Without advancements, nothing new will get created and we won't be able to reach the surface or get any closer than we have today. ",Rebuttal
Despite all of the potentially dangerous things about Venus there is still alot to benefit,Rebuttal
but the author goes on to describe just why and how scientist should pursue Venus.,Rebuttal
"However, in order to learn all there is about Venus, you would have to go onto Venus. This is almost an impossible task though.",Rebuttal
"But there could be more than what meets the eye. In parapgraph six, the writer says that,"" peering a Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions becuase most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere.""",Rebuttal
"but what are they trying to collect, find, or explore.
",Rebuttal
it is simply just too dangerous.,Rebuttal
"However, without the background information about Venus's surfaces and atmosphere it may not be understood as to why the journey to Venus is such a trouble. The author provides information that can help understand the reason that astronomers should study Venus. ",Rebuttal
"While having passion is important so is having a valid reason as to why others should care but instead the closest to any sort of valid reason we get is ""to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight gained on the planet itself, but also human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors,""",Rebuttal
"But I am a firm beleiver that our planet should come first, after all, we do only get one Earth, that means we must take care of it. Maybe one day when Our problems down here are solved and we have the ability to really gain benifits from Venus then I will want us to explore more. But for now I'm sticking to the thought that our planet comes first ",Rebuttal
But the author does think that venus should be explored dispite the conditions,Rebuttal
but mechanical mechines can be used be cause they are not electrical like computers or smartphones ,Rebuttal
but he realizes that it's more important that we find a way to observe and explore it ,Rebuttal
Though he talks about how it could be helpful to learn about it.,Rebuttal
" However, some solutions are there. one solution would be to ""allow scientists to float above the fray""(paragraph 5) ",Rebuttal
there are ways for humans to survive them. ,Rebuttal
" The author pushes to try those plans out in a realistic manner. The author being realistic with the reader, makes the reader want agree with him more. ",Rebuttal
the author also included that.,Rebuttal
"""Radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans",Rebuttal
however would the time and money be worth it if its not a positive fact the structures sent to Venus will even survive? I would say no. ,Rebuttal
but the author's claim needs to be more supported and obvious throught the passage. ,Rebuttal
"However, the author seems to forget that these kind of enviromental hurdels take time and money to jump over.",Rebuttal
This idea seems legitiment except for one thing.,Rebuttal
"it seems to me like it would make no common sense. He says that Venus once looked just like the Earth, but for me it doesn't matter how it once looked like because then we would first go into time traveling and that is not what this article is about ",Rebuttal
"I don't think that this is a good idea, because it would take so much work and money just to see things that we can see without a human being there. ",Rebuttal
"All of these seem like deal breakers, but the author does a good job of countering these points with solutions. The author describes ideas from NASA, such as a ""blimp-like vehicle"" that would float about thirty miles above the surface of Venus and avoid many of the harshest conition. He also disusses the use of electronics made of silicon carbide that would be better equipped to handle the intense conditions of Venus.",Rebuttal
that doesn't explain why we need to waste resources exploring such inhospitable territory. ,Rebuttal
" However, NASA has a study that scientists will be able to use a vehicle that can hover above Venus. This keeps people safe and helps us discover more of Venus.",Rebuttal
"But, they believe they can make a machince that last long enough to live to take those samples.",Rebuttal
The author does inspire interest in the topic. ,Rebuttal
"Nonetheless, the author did a great job of backing up the counterclaim. The author argued back the counterclaim by explaining how Venus was once like Earth.",Rebuttal
But NASA has developed an idea that might truely get humans close to Venus to be able to study it. NASA says that they could send a craft to float or hover about 30 or so miles above the surface to escape the harsh Venusian storms and landscape ,Rebuttal
They plan to use mechanical computers that run because of gears and levers and would not require electronics. These forms of computers were used during World War II because they did not require electricity and how they are capable of withstanding much punishment from harsh conditions. ,Rebuttal
Just because a planet has something dangerour that can cause harm does not mean we should stop learning about it or try and see it's physical features it has.,Rebuttal
"Although, the author does say that it wouldn't be impossible to live there.",Rebuttal
"Consequently, the author states in paragraph six that there are now many scienstist searching for technology that will be able to stand the harsh conditions in Venus ",Rebuttal
" but here are the downsides to that. Venus now is not like Earth, it is more like a destroyed Earth. ",Rebuttal
"Despite these facts given, the article ends with ""our travels onEarth and beyond should not be limited by dangerous and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (8) and this contributes to why visiting Venus is worth it, making all the reasons against visiting less effective because they are not explained as thoroughly throughout. ",Rebuttal
"Yes there are many reasons of why we shoudn't take this trip to Venus, but there are ways that scientists have figured out to avoid and make the trip safer. ",Rebuttal
"but some students jus have a sad or mad face everyday for no reason so the Facial Action Coding Syestem may read their facial expressionand say that student is mad , when the student is just doing there normal face  ",Rebuttal
" Although, that is not always the case with students ",Rebuttal
"However, a computer cannot feel, cannot have sympathy, and cannot understand many things about humans.",Rebuttal
The computer could suggest the student is feeling one emotion but the student could really be feeling another.,Rebuttal
"it is proven to be otherwise. In fact, it is very well developed and the article states, ",Rebuttal
"it does not always work that way. In the article Dr. Huang says ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication... So computers needd to understand that, too.""",Rebuttal
"but, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression,"" they are still universal. While one student might be stressing himself out and have wide eyes, a student next to him might just have his eyebrows furrowed. If the computers identify the differences in actions but similarities in emotions, that can really help students.
",Rebuttal
Ather than that there probably wouldnt be any other problems because technology would be getting better by the year. ,Rebuttal
"However kids need to let people help them anyway they can.
",Rebuttal
but my computer would end up crashing and the whole purpose of the experiment would be destroyed,Rebuttal
the Facial Action Coding System can definitely enhance learning for a better understanding,Rebuttal
" it could help faculty see those students who might be depressed or angry, and need help. ",Rebuttal
"but every since the invention of technology, hackers, crackers, and similar people have always been able to exploit security issues and gain access to the databases with images of faces ",Rebuttal
"but often, for products like this, the information is woefully incomplete or exaggerated.",Rebuttal
"However, humans can also react much more appropriately. Also, there is no guarantee that the technology would read emotions correctly. And unlike fingerprint scanners or facial recognition, there is no second chance with emotions. Either the computer interprets them incorrectly or correctly.",Rebuttal
 but we are not always able to tell whether or not someone is faking their happiness. ,Rebuttal
However more advancement and developments of this technology in the future could benefit many people in different circumstances. ,Rebuttal
but some other people may also think that is just as same as other technology ,Rebuttal
but like i said it should be banned because there is no point on having that techology if that person tells you how they are felling.,Rebuttal
but please this is not for our students just for their teachers to read their emotions and invading their privacy,Rebuttal
Thats great but honestly I dont think this would be the best thing in the world. ,Rebuttal
"But to be honest i really think its not a good idea because why you have a computer trying to sovle people problems when you can just have them talk to someone about it , it dont make sense to have extra stuff to help kids when its a soical worker there. ",Rebuttal
"but, I do not believe that with the 7 Billion different people on this Earth, one piece of technology could be capable of acuratly telling us the exact emotions someone is feeling at that moment. Not just by scanning someone's facial expressions at least.",Rebuttal
students can actualy learn from it.,Rebuttal
These are things that come with everything no matter what it is.,Rebuttal
 But sometimes just looking at someone does not always workout as some people would like ,Rebuttal
"but when is solved hopefully, we can have them in our classrooms in the future this could be the most valuable ""teacher"" so far it would be of a great value for schools.  ",Rebuttal
"Well if that happended then their would be someone on stand by to turn off the robot and start working on him. So the robot could get back as fast as he could. Well what if that person is sick one day and the robot goes beserk. Then we will have a second person on stand by.
",Rebuttal
See they are doing it for fun. ,Rebuttal
"Despite that, the machine can understand students that day. With a better understanding for the student, the lesson can be adjusted to make it more comprehensable",Rebuttal
but this tecnology would not be helpful in a classroom where all kids are doing is learning,Rebuttal
 But even if that's the reason for not trying this out I believe it would be good for the kids and they would learn something new and different.,Rebuttal
"But, that's what makes the Facial Action Coding System so unique and valuable because students often have blank expressions protrayed on their face anyhow. ",Rebuttal
but that doesn't mean that also doesn't mean that it might do a lot of things right either.,Rebuttal
but who would want to feel like their being watched?,Rebuttal
 but thinking about the author feels versus the way every one else would feel puts this topic on hold.,Rebuttal
but it really just feels like an invasion of the students privacy.,Rebuttal
At least according to some new computer software you can recognize emotions. The software is the least innovation.,Rebuttal
but after a while of receiving help they would realize that it is worth it.,Rebuttal
 but it is still very helpful. ,Rebuttal
Yes this technology can read facial expressions but can they truly understand why we are feeling this way or whats going on through our head.,Rebuttal
But i also know that sometimes the teacher is to busy helping other kids or even maybe other teachers,Rebuttal
But that's what further devlopment is for. FACS will keep pushing and making more progress when being able to tell a person's emotion.,Rebuttal
However even though it is flawed these flaws can be fixed ,Rebuttal
but I disagree it being used in a classroom for the teacher to see what you are doing. ,Rebuttal
 i can gret that but at the same time you could get help anything can happen to you while your down and it could be really helpful or maybe go to a consoulor to talk to or anything. ,Rebuttal
But for the most part teen and other people would like these in a cool way to use ,Rebuttal
 though it isn't good either.,Rebuttal
"but on the negative side it just gives another thing to go wrong in a classroom.

I mean don't we already have enough technology in classrooms to helps us out and distract us. ",Rebuttal
Maybe if it goes outside a certain range of school the software will stop but the computer can still be used. ,Rebuttal
"it is still going to be for a good cause. life will be hard but there will be less coruption, deaths etc. after the whole prosses the new generation to come will be better than us, and thats what life is really about.",Rebuttal
"they still dont know whats the matter,",Rebuttal
It would be more practicle for you in different ways such as ajusting a lesson in school when you are starting to get bored or drousy.,Rebuttal
" Though it sounds like a step towards the right direction in technology, students will be just as bored doing random classwork on a computer without emotion software watching their every move through a camera. ",Rebuttal
"but lets be honest, that is what our world is coming to anyways. Technology is taking over our lives and almost everything, from shopping to communicating, is being done online. So there isn't much change going on if we move our classroom ciriculum to the internet.",Rebuttal
Although there are more benifits than problems in the system. ,Rebuttal
",however as a everyday thing, it would be too much and not that useful.",Rebuttal
 it is still a very good tool to use in the classroom or anywhere needed,Rebuttal
This technology sounds very convincing but think of an emotionally challenged teenager can the computer keep up or truly read the emotions of the teen just by facial expressions alone?,Rebuttal
but how far would it modify it. Also if this became a thing would it take the place of teachers. If so than that would be a bad thing. So many people would lose their jobs.,Rebuttal
but I still think it is a bad idea. ,Rebuttal
 but this also could be bad because if the computer just throws the kid on the spot it would make the kid even more shy or nervous then what they already are ,Rebuttal
I do not think that schools are ready for a program that studies the students' faces ,Rebuttal
How is the data going to be of use in science?,Rebuttal
but they also say what if they become evil and they go against us and take over the world and kill us all. i think that if they ever make robots and that were to happen then it was all planned because this bings me back to my point. robots dont have souls which means that they cant procces haterate in them. unless they were programed to feel hate but they are sensative so if they actually learn how scientist wants them to learn then i believe that they still wouldnt take over the world unless they were programed to.,Rebuttal
"However, it is more likely that a bigger percentage of students woud have a positive outcome while having this advanced technology in the classrooms.
",Rebuttal
"Although that could be the case, we should focus on whether the students believe they are being benefitted while using it",Rebuttal
"In reality, this technology continues to prove its many values, and it's evergrowing amount of benifits that completly overpower all the ideas that some may think its unnimportant.",Rebuttal
So there would have to be some type of agreement and some rules. Also I would want what the programs reads about my emotions to only be shared with me and not be accsessed by others. Its a personal thing. ,Rebuttal
but i dont see that helping much at all because knowing someone's emotions won't effect the way that the surgeon will go through on the operation. ,Rebuttal
"But, this system can save suicidal people from all over the world.",Rebuttal
We can however look forward to the day that this kind of tecnology is avalable to the masses to use to further society and possibly save trroubled lives and reach all students.,Rebuttal
"That to understandable. However, some students are afraid to ask for help because they don't want to be precieved as dumb or unintelligent ",Rebuttal
but we're still in the beginning faze of the FACS. By using the system we would become way more advanced and learn how to fix these problems,Rebuttal
This is a huge flaw because people can already log into a computer happy or upset but the FACS isn't going to know that so the system is basically ruined. ,Rebuttal
 but how is it going to change the lesson to make it better? ,Rebuttal
This would change everything about how we learn. That is the problem. We could change a system that has put people on the moon. ,Rebuttal
 but this is a new day and age and its hard to escape technology.,Rebuttal
The Facial Action Coding System can tell if you are being truthful or not.,Rebuttal
"in all reality, teachers for the must part can see when a student is struggling, and would not need this system. We are all humans with feelings and we all deserve to have some type of privacy. ",Rebuttal
there are many reasons that prove a system like this in the classroom can be very useful. ,Rebuttal
but really we have no right till about 21 years of age.,Rebuttal
but sometimes a teacher should know if your having a hard time or if your even bored in class.,Rebuttal
"but at the same time it doesn't because yes students do get bored or confused frequently, but modifying the lesson for one or two students is not worth the technology.",Rebuttal
"Dr. Huang addresses this by introducing that the computer first constructs a 3-D model of the face, with all the muscles operating as a human's would.",Rebuttal
but the logic is right before our eyes.,Rebuttal
"While this is true, students are only watched to monitor their actions in the school environment to ensure the safety of the students.",Rebuttal
This would be a great thing for the students if we already have a human instructer. It is a teachers job to do the tasks that has been stated above. ,Rebuttal
but i just dont think it would be all that if it wouldn't actually ready are real emotion at all. so thier is no need to even have the technology that they have now. ,Rebuttal
 but only If the person that you are using it on would like you to know their mood. ,Rebuttal
"But rather than that it doesn't help us. It doesn't help us get good grades, doesn't show us what to do in class, and doesn't help your teachers eitheir. ",Rebuttal
But if some student were to agree on being read if could potentionally help them academically and emotionally. ,Rebuttal
 I still feel that this is a great idea and should actually be in school ,Rebuttal
But no special computer is needed as in the article states that this program could run on a school computer. ,Rebuttal
but the problem being is that a program so complex like that requires so much code and algorithms that it requires a beffy computer to run so you would need to make multiple servers capable of holding that much information not only that but the school would have to divert much more of their budget toward stronger computers,Rebuttal
It would be a nice thing to do,Rebuttal
"Dr. Huang says ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"", he firmly believes that his new software can identify the most mixed emotions with the use of video imagery and emotion recognition.",Rebuttal
"but seeing peoples emotions right now, it isn't something that is very useful to the world today ",Rebuttal
But what can this program do that a teacher's survey could not? ,Rebuttal
"Therefore, although this system is useful in the fact that it can gauge the emotions of the students, it is not much more useful than a teacher who can do the same thing by questioning their students on their preferences and ideas. ",Rebuttal
the auhtor of the article mentions that certain muscles (risorius and zygomatic major) can determine the difference between and fake smile and a real smile. So who's to say that all emotions don't have that same type of tell.,Rebuttal
"But, the system would tell you their exact emotions.
",Rebuttal
"however, an teacher might just over look it or not be able to tell what the student is feeling.",Rebuttal
"For the time being i think we should leave the schools how they are until we can finally bring this in for students in the future when its more avalible to everyone.
",Rebuttal
 but the one thing that means the most is your security. ,Rebuttal
but unfortunatley the bad outweighs the good.,Rebuttal
but if you are in harms way and still will not express what is going on then this device would be exremely helpful. ,Rebuttal
"The technology has the intelligence to identify mixed emtions which is helpful because most people have trouble percieving facial traits and expressions.

If my school had this software, I would be all over it trying to find out how I feel because sometimes I don't even know my own emotions. ",Rebuttal
On the other hand we dont know how many types of emotions there are listed within the machine there could be almost all emotions plugged into it. ,Rebuttal
"Yes it does seem interesting but like I said before, it should not be used in a classroom",Rebuttal
but it would be useless in a middle or high school classroom and just cause distractions.,Rebuttal
but I also this it could hurt as well.,Rebuttal
but i think it is bad because teachers for example would use it whenever and espically when a student is mad or acting strange or if the teacher and student got in an argument.,Rebuttal
Some are also very excited to see if the computer would actually say how they are feeling and their imotions they are feeling.,Rebuttal
" But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscel clues are sometimes used to spot a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity [that] isn't being truthful."" ",Rebuttal
"but some other parents may like the idea of using FACS in the school because they can know how their kids are feeling.
",Rebuttal
 but if they think about it instead of waisting your time just guessing what their emotions are you would know if they use the proper techonology. They had made a process that began when the computer constructed a 3-D computer model of the face and it showed that all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. ,Rebuttal
"but, think about it this device could help our society through many ways other than just preveniting mass shootings . ",Rebuttal
I feel they would be all means use this in the best way possible.,Rebuttal
"But that why we got eyes for , to look and see things ",Rebuttal
but this is not much different than being able to tell how one feels by just examining their expression by oneself ,Rebuttal
but others would. Students don't like to show their emotions sometimes ,Rebuttal
I still don't believe that can ever happen because we express how we feel we can't count our emotions. ,Rebuttal
 Having the system would be better than nothing though. It's better to know how the kids are feeling rather than not knowing at all. ,Rebuttal
"but with the positive outcomes that would follow, whatever cost paid would be well worth it. ",Rebuttal
Most of they time they can invade people privice and realtionship.,Rebuttal
as long as no student or teacher abusses it to know what are others feeling about you or something else.,Rebuttal
"I feel it is necessary to keep it that way, in respect for the student.",Rebuttal
but it is stil amazing because they wont have to do much just snap a picture and thee program will caulculate it think about how many crimes this will solve . ,Rebuttal
"There would never be a dull moment in front of the computer though.
",Rebuttal
" It has some pros but there are alot ot cons to it.

This article has alot of good points in it but I still dont agree with what it is saying. ",Rebuttal
"However, humans who do not show a great amount of facial expressions can still show a slight amount, which would be enough for the computer to detect. ",Rebuttal
Others might just nit want to answer the question. So it would be easier to just get your answer from a mechine that gives you the answer you want. ,Rebuttal
"but at the end of the day, that's their problem. This app could be useful in some way but would you really want to calculate someones emotions?",Rebuttal
"While that would be particularly useful in an academic field, it may not work as well as anticipated. Every human being is unique and different, so therefore, they can become confused for different reasons or get bored of different things. ",Rebuttal
 But as we know thing's can easily lead to something bigger. ,Rebuttal
it could be a great use in the school board today with all the violence and cyber communication that happens.,Rebuttal
These people can just take there time and teach themselves how to read them. ,Rebuttal
If it can take a whole classroom and spit out how each individual felt at that exact moment then we should us them in classes,Rebuttal
"Fortunately, the creators have already thought of this problem, and conjured up a solution. ",Rebuttal
"i could disagree with that aslo because the face msucles is what produces the expression, the muscles move your smile up, your cheeks more purky, to seem more happy and or sad. Muscles are the first step to identifying visually how a person is feeling which doesn't exactly need a technilogical discoverance. ",Rebuttal
but if they did come out with the facial action coding system it would be kinda cool,Rebuttal
"This could be solved by making the students sign a waver stating that they are okay with having their emotions read.
",Rebuttal
"there are simply too many students for that one computer to process, which would make the entire system useless. ",Rebuttal
like we already know how we feel everyday why should we have a coding system that should code the wrong information and makes us seem like we wasted our time and money.,Rebuttal
but only for an expermint ,Rebuttal
"So as long as prices arent varied by place and can stay low, all schoold should have these types of learning tools because it really does help these children, and could have a better success rate in lower schools.",Rebuttal
"However, it is never healthy to hide such strong emotions, especally if there are people around you willing to help. ",Rebuttal
"This is a valid argument, but this also compromises the position of school counselors.",Rebuttal
the computer tell them what they are doing wrong and change it to where the classroom is fun but you also get alot of learning in. ,Rebuttal
But I dont blieve this computer can tell people feelings.,Rebuttal
" If schools invested in this system, it could change those that don't want expressed to being expressed and happier. It could also just tell you where your're at and what emotions you could work on or otherwise.",Rebuttal
"However, this device is still not trust worthty",Rebuttal
But what if we are trying to hide emotions for our or others good and technology just cames and reads or decodes your emotions how would you feel? ,Rebuttal
"But then again, this new technology could end up being very beneficial to both the student and the teacher",Rebuttal
it is simply something you would want to have in a classroom ,Rebuttal
"but other hen that I wouldn't like havving this type of system in my classroom.
",Rebuttal
This technology is very positive but still has its down sides,Rebuttal
 but this approach could also make students feel uncomfortable.,Rebuttal
"However, while some arguements may be warranted, many are based off of falsehoods. To begin, emotion can be understood on a scientific level.",Rebuttal
"Which in all ways could be a great addition, but if you take into consideration all the cons. That one pro just isn't enough ",Rebuttal
 it would solve more problems than it could create ,Rebuttal
it shouldn't be used to collect information on how people are emotionally feeling without permission.,Rebuttal
 there is little use for computers undertsanding how humans feel if they can not help the individual with their emotons. ,Rebuttal
 Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars ,Rebuttal
there is no true evedance that aliens do eggsist and also that the aliens did this face.,Rebuttal
but the NASA tells evertything to the public about teir investigation so there for there is no true evedance that the NASA is hiding things about their invesigations to the public. ,Rebuttal
scientists like Jim Garvin say the the face on Mars was not made by alians and it is a natural land form like a mesa. ,Rebuttal
"However, NASA scientists, like myself, know that this is no extraterrestrial impression on the face of Mars, but rather a small mountain or hill that seems to resemble a face.
",Rebuttal
"But the ""Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look ",Rebuttal
but NASA would actually benefit from an ancient civilization. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. ,Rebuttal
"NASA said it was a ""huge rock information"" because it is very similar to a human's face. Next, you cannot just asumed the planet was made from aliens because there is a human's face on it. You got to study the artifact before you can assume it is from aliens. ",Rebuttal
"Next, on April 8,2001 they got a picture of the Face,""Malin's team captured an extraordinary using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" So overall the technology for the camera was very equiped. ",Rebuttal
These theories can not hold true because NASA would benifit greatly on finding life on Mars. NASA's profits would begin to increase. ,Rebuttal
"This is not true, and I know this because even the people from NASA say they wish there was civilization on Mars. If NASA found civilization on Mars, they would announce it because it's exciting.",Rebuttal
"Once again, Michael Malin goes back and takes photos in an even higher resolution. The new resolution helped capture the real size of the Face.",Rebuttal
that's why there was another trip with more advanced equipment ,Rebuttal
 But that is not true it would benifit NASA if it were an true artifact. ,Rebuttal
"Yet there's a problem, that picture was taken in the 1970s, and if you remember, the cameras weren't all that great. And there have been multiple other pictures taken of the same landformation, like in 1998, and 2001.",Rebuttal
"Furthermore 3 years later they took more pictures of the exact place of the original siting of the mysterious and erriy face, but once again the cameras do not lie as it unvieled the same blan rock formation, but the press couldn't argue this time.",Rebuttal
"that is correct. If the aliens did make it then we wouldn't have showed the public the photos. We would want to keep it out of newspapers, magazine, tv shows, and movies. ",Rebuttal
It may look that way in the past but only because the images we captured then were not as inhansed as the ones now ,Rebuttal
"But at this time, technology wasn't at it's highest.",Rebuttal
"At that point, they just sound ignorant, but no matter their claim, they are wrong and have no strong evidence in saying it isn't natural. ",Rebuttal
"but just cause of that it doesn't mean it was made by aliens.
",Rebuttal
"""JPL already has proof that it is just natural, they said it was a butte or mesa, landforms common around American West, besides, do you truly think there are little green guys with really big foreheads and wierd eyes just walking around mars. I mean I don't want to sound mean, but if you truly think that, then there is something going on in your head that isn't quite healthy,"" I said.",Rebuttal
"""There is no way any life form could have a face two miles from end to end, that is just obserd. Plus, if you think that there is just some hidden life form out there surviving and making places to live, than how do you sleep at night.''",Rebuttal
"""I just can't believe you would think this ignorantly, I have known you for fifteen years,and you are the smartest human being I know.""",Rebuttal
", but NASA unveiled an image of the Face and this is what they came up with. According to the caption of the image, it noted a ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, annd mouth.""",Rebuttal
" This did not stop mission controllers, and they prepared to look again.",Rebuttal
"Now this may all sound convincing, but it was also added that you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, causing false illusions. ",Rebuttal
I'm stil shocked that people think they're real. I've never seen one before ,Rebuttal
"However, that was back in April of 1998, and the most recent photo taken was back in 2001.",Rebuttal
" Even so, it is unlikely that all the markings would be covered up, but we began to get ready to look again to hopefully settle everything about the Face. ",Rebuttal
they have no concrete evidence ,Rebuttal
but it is really not. ,Rebuttal
They could not have because there is not any evidence that aliens did it ,Rebuttal
"but if this had been something NASA was hiding, they wouldn't have show that photo at all to the public. ",Rebuttal
What's the difference its just a camera ,Rebuttal
"but this is false.

If NASA really found life forms on a diffrent planet they would tell every body because they would make a lot of money ",Rebuttal
 but just as much as that could be true it could also be wrong.,Rebuttal
" but that day was completely clear and ""sunny""",Rebuttal
"The reason why i dont think this face was created by aliens is because just like on earth there is erosion,rocks,and plaitonic movement.",Rebuttal
"but I think that it is not possible for them to exist this close to us and we have not found out about it yet, therefore they are not real. ",Rebuttal
"Which were not likely it could of been the air,because the human like face was located in the north martian latitude where it was already winter. It could of been the breeze from the snow. ",Rebuttal
This reasoning behind believeing that there is life on Mars is unfactual and merely people's opinion.,Rebuttal
there still was no alien markings to be found after the next picture they took on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia ,Rebuttal
"though some say that life on Mars does exist, I think that there is no life on Mars. ",Rebuttal
"but many things look like something else, and it doesn't mean thats what they are, because of looks ",Rebuttal
But there weren't any on the third more clearer photograph. ,Rebuttal
"Well, we checked again at a time when it was clear and you could see everything fine. There were no alien markings. Like I said, if there were we would have been extatic. The whole world would have known about it within a few days. ",Rebuttal
" But, how could aliens have done it? No one knows. ",Rebuttal
"But there is also no scientific research or evidnce that aliens are real. Which all leads up to, ""Is the Face on Mars really made by aliens?"" the answer is no
",Rebuttal
"But it could possibly be something else. It could be a mountain with craters, it can be mostly anything. ",Rebuttal
"Well no, yes that rumor started, but to prove them wrong on April 8, 2001 we decided to take another picture, making sure it was a cloudless summer day.",Rebuttal
"You should know NASA isn't hiding anything from the people because if there was evidence of life it would benefit us, so why hide it?",Rebuttal
" By the looks of the images, I could see that every year they have taken it, I can see that it's disappearing.",Rebuttal
I thought that was perpostourous but my colleague still believed the theory of aliens existing. ,Rebuttal
But it was real alright and we have the evidence to prove it. ,Rebuttal
"That may be possible but, its more likely to be a shadow caused by the formation of he land.",Rebuttal
"But, When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, they saw that it was just a natural land form. ",Rebuttal
"however, it is similar to the land forms on Earth. Plus, there are tons of land forms on Mars, so why would this one be any different. ",Rebuttal
"But that cant be true since NASA eventually went out and took an even better picture in 2001, proving that the Face is nothing more than a natural landform. ",Rebuttal
"However, life does not exist on Mars; therefore, the ""face"" could not be built by aliens.",Rebuttal
"But, why would NASA hide that they found an alien civilization? That could only help the company, not hurt them.",Rebuttal
Mars Global Surveyer drew close enough for a second look ,Rebuttal
Sadly we have discovered that it was just a natural landform. ,Rebuttal
" there is no true evidence to prove so. In fact, scientist have came up with more ways that the Face is not life rather than if it was.",Rebuttal
"Therefore, a high-resolution image from more recent technology offically confirmed that the Face is just a mesa. ",Rebuttal
But that's why we have researchers like NASA. To look into theories with more knowledge behind them and see how they turn out afterwords. ,Rebuttal
"there is too much evidence that denies it, and that it isn't.",Rebuttal
 it turns out to be just a Martian equivalent of a mesa ,Rebuttal
"But,then why wouldn't it looks fuler or have actuale face there would be bones. And if there was a statues then why is it only it's head you would a lest find the other parts of the statue but we haven't and that's because it only a land form shaped into something almost everyone beleives to be actuale life.",Rebuttal
 Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acncient civilization on Mars ,Rebuttal
"On April 8, 2001, there was a cloudles day on Mars. The surveyor drew close for another picture.",Rebuttal
"Garvin says, ""Targeting Cydonia was not easy...in fact it is hard to work",Rebuttal
All I could think of is why and how would they do it.,Rebuttal
"Although if this was proof of life forms on Mars then that would greatly benefit NASA so why would they try and cover it up? Well the answer is they wouldnt. If there was any proof that there was life forms on Mars then NASA would benefit greatly and they would most likely reveal that to the public as well, not hide it. ",Rebuttal
they are mistaken.,Rebuttal
"However, NASA has nothing to gain from hiding information from the world. If anything, NASA would want the world to know about ancient aliens building landforms.",Rebuttal
"Thus aftward scienctists tried to take another picture of Cydonia (The Face) with the improved technology and show that there is no life on Mars and that the face is just a landform on Mars.

In the image it did look more like a landform",Rebuttal
"On April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day had come and it was time to take a picture of the Face. The photo was taken with maximum resolution, and when people saw the picture there was no mistaking it for a landform on Mars.",Rebuttal
We gave people what they want and we went to look for it again.,Rebuttal
"still Nasa has even more proof that this ""face'' is indeed a montain with shadows stratigicly placed to look like a human face.",Rebuttal
but Nasa declines and this time Nasa has a little more proof. ,Rebuttal
well it is not.,Rebuttal
but in 2001 a newer image was taken ,Rebuttal
"The argument that isn't even factual.

You are going off of a guess in your mind. ",Rebuttal
"
Yes, i understand how skeptics actually believe that the face was made by aliens because they dont know how it was created. They don't know who created it either.",Rebuttal
"However, they even took pictures on a cloudless day, and it still appeard as a natural landform. ",Rebuttal
But NASA kept saying other wise. ,Rebuttal
"But then the question comes to be WHY would Nasa be trying to hide some of this information from the public? Well it comes down to the simple fact they arent trying to hide anything from the public about the face they are giving us the true information and some people just dont thig thats the real actual truth.
",Rebuttal
"Nasa would have wanted people to know if there was life on Mars, because Nasa's budget has been cut. ",Rebuttal
"If you look at the picture though, it is clearly a natural landform ",Rebuttal
Even though only some scientist think its an alien artifact NASA made it their top prority. As they as they could they were going to gdet another photograph of the face ,Rebuttal
"Finally on April 8, 2001 they got a clearer view for another picture ",Rebuttal
" fog happens on Earth too. If we take this even farther, it could have just been that the lens were fogged up, or the area was getting something like precipitation",Rebuttal
" Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" The media blew up at the idea of the Face being signs of intelligent life forms on other planets, despite what the scientists had to say about what the face truly was. ",Rebuttal
Maybe there were bones from a human body attatched to the head.,Rebuttal
This is also not true.,Rebuttal
"The thing that they do not realize is the fact that they have no proof of NASA ""making up"" a story like this. ",Rebuttal
"sorry to burtst your bubble but, you are wrong.",Rebuttal
NASA would not hide stuff like this for many reasons. ,Rebuttal
But if this was true why would NASA not realease it to get a huge government grant to try and develope a way to send people to Mars to explore.,Rebuttal
when we zoomed in there was no evidence supporting that alien built or form the figure that we saw. ,Rebuttal
"Now for us we wish there was an acient civilization on Mars, but we can't hide the truth.",Rebuttal
But I told him that it was a natural landform because when we waited to get the best picture in 1998 all we saw was a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. ,Rebuttal
"So more research was done. Scientist took more pictures, which were ten times sharper than the first ones, and stutdied them. Discovering, the obivious, that it was a natural landform.

There was dissapointment all over the place, not only for the people, but scientist too. ",Rebuttal
but the people at NASA say it was just created by a natural landform,Rebuttal
"So, in 1998, another photo was taken of the face. It was ten times sharper than the original Viking photo, and it still revealed only just a natural landform.",Rebuttal
" But then a couple years later in 2001, scientists got another image of the Face on a clear day with the camera's absolute maximum resolution, (and you would be able to see any objects or markings that was there) and there was still no signs of markings indicating alien interaction. ",Rebuttal
but why would we want to hide the fact that there is life on Mars when in reality it would benefit here at NASA.,Rebuttal
But if there was life on this planet it dont you think it would have shown itself a little bit more and not hide for 25 years giving us one piece of evidence that its real. ,Rebuttal
"When NASA took another photo in April of 2001, the photo does not seem to portray any alien markings. ",Rebuttal
"If that was the case, then how come, in all of the photos and evidence we have from Mars, NASA has never once seen a Martian.",Rebuttal
"Well, I am here to tell you that it is not real. ",Rebuttal
"We had an extraordinary photo that had pixel spans that were 1.56 meters. That was much better compared to1976 when the yfirst took the picturses.

What the picture actually showed was land forms that were common around the Amercian West. ",Rebuttal
"Three years later, NASA proved our skeptical theorists wrong again.",Rebuttal
they are wrong.,Rebuttal
"NASA responds to conspiracy theorist in this way, because if NASA were to be responsible for discovering life on Mars, they would benefit.",Rebuttal
I think this face is a natural landform. ,Rebuttal
On the other hand there are people who support the fact that the Face is just another landform on Mars.,Rebuttal
Now on my side of the story or opinion it clearly looks like a landform ,Rebuttal
"The truth is, they took amazing photos with maximum resolution on April 8th, 2001, and there were no markings, aircrafts, little structures, or pyramids to be seen anywhere. ",Rebuttal
"But on April 8, 2001 he set out for another picture. They took an extrodinary picture. Again it proved it was just a landform.",Rebuttal
But it has been photograghed numorous time and with even better detail and it look like it was made by nature not some other beings ,Rebuttal
 people who believe in aliens strongly are going to find the slightest detail and use that for their evidence. Since this was a popluar icon more and more people are going to lie and make up stuff to make sure people believe it is true. They already made up a lie that we would rather hide from the aliens. These people are called conspiracy theorists. ,Rebuttal
 dont you belive their would be some type of evidence of a life form on Earth ,Rebuttal
"For the first statement I can say that could be true, but the question I can't answer. I sure that someone who has studied it could though. ",Rebuttal
but that is something that can't be proven or disproven. ,Rebuttal
"But life on mars would be good for NASA,",Rebuttal
In this sitiuation We're trying to convience people and tell them that aliens has nothing to do with this. ,Rebuttal
"So even though that there was no sign of life on Mars, there has to be life somewhere out in the universe. ",Rebuttal
"The author says, ""Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001a cloudless summer day in CydoniaMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look...What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West ",Rebuttal
" In defense, NASA has scientifically proven the ""Face"" is just a natural landform created on Mars. ""What the picture really shows is the Martien equivalent of a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" (p.12).
",Rebuttal
 but defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilisation on mars becuase then NASA would get more money to go to mars. ,Rebuttal
but if there was life on Mars we would people to know that. When all the pictures came out they made a bunch of money. The face has actually become an pop icon. So if there was life on Mars we would want to share it with the public. ,Rebuttal
"However, NASA wouldn't lie about this kind of discovery because it would also be very helpful for them. ",Rebuttal
"but, as thoughtfully pointed out in the article, the existance of ancient alien life would benefit them immensely. In this case, there is no reason for them to hide anything.
",Rebuttal
"However, as previously mentioned, NASA would benefit if this ancient civilization was real. Therefore, there is no logical reason they would keep this from us.",Rebuttal
"Well, in paragraph 11 Garvin says that ,"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Eqytian -style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were. ",Rebuttal
Well in paragraph 10 they said that they rolled their spacecraft 25 degrees to center in the Face in the feild of veiw. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camer's absolute maximum reslotion ,Rebuttal
Scientists still held onto their beliefs and avoided correction by a few simple facts.,Rebuttal
I told Zeke i worked for Nasa so I would know way more than he does an I insured him it was not an alien artifact and it was just a mesa which looked to be something it wasn't and that he shouldn't be so stubborn about it and just believe me.,Rebuttal
Why would NASA want to hide it though ,Rebuttal
They don't know just because this thing goes publice dosen't mean it is true.,Rebuttal
This therory is highly impossible that it is evidence of a ancient Martian civilization.,Rebuttal
"This proves that aliens markings are not hidden by haze; it's the time of year where it is cloudy on Mars, making it harder to see the Face. ",Rebuttal
NASA decided that better photoes were requiered to qwell theas rummors.,Rebuttal
Three years later we recieved the best results possible. the photo not only showed no carvings but it also showed that there was no face at all!,Rebuttal
"That is not true without the evidence. Which, there is none. There are ablolutly zero facts that aliens would be able to make a face. Or that there are aliens. No facts. No aliens. If there were aliens how would they even make a face?
",Rebuttal
"but from the evidence we have, this is not true. ",Rebuttal
"The skeptics were right when they said that they had to peek through haze, however they were wrong about the part where they said the haze hid the alien markings ",Rebuttal
"Thats a logical reason but I still dont think it is realistic enough. If the haze did not show up in the picture that they took, how could they of not saw it.",Rebuttal
but in my prespective I believe that you can't just go and and discover that and it all be fake it's not happening and it never like that ,Rebuttal
Finally I can say that ''Face on Mars'' was not created by aliens ,Rebuttal
" That's not true. NASA is a company that needs money like all the rest. They know that telling people that aliens were real would profit them a lot, so they wouldn't just hide the fact that the Face was an alien artifact if it was one. NASA probably wishes that they had found an ancient cililization on Mars, just for the profit. ",Rebuttal
I tell him that Nasa was able to figure it out because a mesa is a a big rock formation that just has a flat top and thats what the face looked like if you see it up close.,Rebuttal
"However, NASA was able to take another picture of the Face when the clouds weren't in the way and it wasn't winter. ",Rebuttal
wich is not true because,Rebuttal
"""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids you could tell what they are. ",Rebuttal
 NASA would greatly benefit from finding actual life on Mars.,Rebuttal
In all seriousness they could be right but it would take a lot more than 25 years to ruin solid rock. ,Rebuttal
"On a cloudless, summer day, the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take the another picture, in hope there was something that they didn't see. Even so, the scientists were proven right again. The Face was really a mesa, a landform common in Cydonia. ",Rebuttal
"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" My question is for you, why would NASA try to cover up or hide that they indeed found aliens or life forms creating things on Mars? ",Rebuttal
there is proof that the Face is not an alien monument of any sort. ,Rebuttal
"In truth, this is false, but many defenders of the NASA budget wish there were signs of alien life ",Rebuttal
so we had sent another spacecraft to see if the face was really was created by aliens or if it was a natural land form ,Rebuttal
"so on April 8th, 2001, A cloudless summer day in Cydonia we drew close enough to the landform for a second look ",Rebuttal
What organization would pass up the opprotunity to get through the roof funding. ,Rebuttal
"My reponse to this is, if there were alien markings, why couldn't you make a brief outline of them in the picture from 1976? And how do you know for sure that there are any alien markings? Many questions arose and taken pictures of the Face became a priority. ",Rebuttal
but that just doesn't make sense. That's like saying that people made the Grand Canyon or that people made the Rocky Mountains.,Rebuttal
If there were aliens than N.A.S.A would probably tell them becuase it would get them so much more publicity and therefore probably more money to fund a mission to mars. So I think that would just be a stupid idea if they kept it a secret. ,Rebuttal
Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.,Rebuttal
"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars.""",Rebuttal
"If NASA had discovered new life on Mars, they would most defineitly share it with the public",Rebuttal
The second thing wrong is the difference between sources of information.,Rebuttal
"Though, NASA defenders wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. ",Rebuttal
"But why would NASA cover somthing as earth shattering as aliens, the publicity alone would help push the government to extend their budget.""",Rebuttal
"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" (P5) Why would litteral rocket scientists cover up something that would help the massively. ",Rebuttal
"With very high resolutioned photos, it is hard for conspiracy theorists to still say that there is face on Mars. It even says in paragraph 11,"" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" ",Rebuttal
"Nevertheless, the caption noted that "" a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head..formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth, "" which means it formed by itself that illustrated a human head. ",Rebuttal
"In some cases though, while we we'er reaserching, we would have noticed already. What we think it is is a natural landform. I know that it sounds crazy, but it is a possibility. It would make more sense if it was a natural landform. ",Rebuttal
"However, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor on ""a cloudless summer day in Cydonia"" and captured another photo.",Rebuttal
Then the picture or 2001 proved that there was no alien markings and that the Face was just a landform. ,Rebuttal
"Which then, NASA had to send more people to look at the face once more.",Rebuttal
"Scientists then took a picture of the landform on a clear, sunny day to prove them wrong; The picture was taken on April 8, 2001.
",Rebuttal
besides that they have no real evidence. ,Rebuttal
The author only did this to attract attention for Mars. ,Rebuttal
but NASA exclaims that they wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars to fund their budget. ,Rebuttal
"The coincidence of a Pharaoh's face appearing on Mars is almost impossible, considering that Pharaohs were people that weren't exactly giants as a two mile wide head would demonstrate.",Rebuttal
" The debate was over it, was and is official that it wasn't a acient alien artifact.
",Rebuttal
"The NASA experts deny all claims with their factual evidence, which easily combats any Conspiracies on the subject.",Rebuttal
" but this camera has the best pixal size and they could see everything.¨ As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixal size¨( Garvin,article11 ) ",Rebuttal
it would be in the news because come on how many aircrafts are sent into space a day most likly about one ever day. ,Rebuttal
"This is, of course, completely absurd to say the very least, due to the lack of evidence they have in corrispondence to the large amount of evidence that we at NASA already have.",Rebuttal
but for right now NASA is winning. Conspiracy theories are theories. Picture evidence is pure fact shown to a persons face. ,Rebuttal
"However, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""",Rebuttal
"This picture, in its high quality, proved that the Face truly was nothing more than a natural landform on Mars. ",Rebuttal
"However, aliens did not create the face on mars. The face was a natural landform, scientists did tons of research on this face. ",Rebuttal
but on the other hand there was no signs of any living thing that could have done this.,Rebuttal
", the defenders for the NASA budget system wishes more than anyone that there was an ancient civilization on Mars. ",Rebuttal
"However, they took much more clear photos . Also if there was an ancient alien civilization NASA would be happy and would tell the world because it would benefit them. ",Rebuttal
"The text states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivanlent of a buttle or mesa-landofrms common aroung the American West. ",Rebuttal
"Mission controlers prepared to look again. The article states that ""we just don't pass over the face very often"".

On April 8, 2001, it was acloundless summer day; the Mars Global Surveyer drew close enough for a second look. In the image things were three times bigger than the Vikings one so you could easily see if there were shacks or small airplanes. ",Rebuttal
"According to paragraph ten in the article, the picture was taken one last time of the landmass revealing the same thing, an average mesa. ",Rebuttal
but the only reason the mesa on Mars has a face is due to the angle at which the picture was taken as I said earlier in my piece. ,Rebuttal
We discovered that there was nothing on there just rocks and natural land.,Rebuttal
"However people still weren't satisfied, so another image was taken on April 8, 2001, on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. Which showed nothing again ",Rebuttal
"NASA's budget only wished that there was actual life on Mars but knew all to well there was no life on Mars. Only a handful of NASA scientists thought of this as an alien artifact, but getting more pictures of it was a top priority for NASA. ",Rebuttal
"On April 8, 2001 on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia the Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for a second look. Using the cameras highest resolution it took a picture of the face. ",Rebuttal
" Now that they know it is a natural landform they will always see it.
",Rebuttal
thats just not the truth ,Rebuttal
"Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took pictures and revealed that the Face was only a natural landform. They also saw that there was no alien monument. Michael and his team said that if it was an ancient civilization, there would've been planes on the ground, Egytian-style pyramids, or small shacks. ",Rebuttal
Malin's team captured a excellent image using the cameras maximum resolution. ,Rebuttal
"But this has no relevance because on there clear weather second attempt of getting a photo , they figured out i was just a natural landform becuase of the fact that in this photo it clearly dipicked that it had many of the same characteristics of natural landforms in the American west. This proves even though that that could have been a civilization it shows that it was only a landform.
",Rebuttal
But there is one problem there is no oxygen up in space so those up there would die in a matter of seconds. ,Rebuttal
"Alien life has yet to be proven and is based off of theories, just like the face on Mars. These people are just ignoring the facts.",Rebuttal
but there is no way they are going to created that Face on Mars. If there is an aliens they wouldn't leave trace like that on Mars.,Rebuttal
"but there is still no strong evidence that it is true, we could be the only living planet in space.
",Rebuttal
We have been searching on Mars since 1975 and there is no known proof that there is any type of living civilization on Mars.,Rebuttal
If this was evidence of life on Mars it would have been a great benefit to NASA. ,Rebuttal
"Defenders claimed that this theory was invalid because life of Mars would benefit NASA, so why would they try to hide it?",Rebuttal
"Mission cotrollers said ""It's not easy to target Cydonia""... ""In fact,

It's hard work"". In spite of all the complications on April 8, 2001, there was a cloudess day in Cydonia and the team was able to get very clear, defined pictures.",Rebuttal
We as in NASA say its just a natural landform. But we do wish there was life on mars. ,Rebuttal
So no one can say that it can still be alien life.,Rebuttal
"Ok you can believe in whatever you want, but i was just simply telling you what we told to other people that also believed it was made by aliens. ",Rebuttal
"The people needed specific evidence to believe that aliens do not exist, so the MGS did just that. ",Rebuttal
 Some people dont under stand that crazy land forms canjus occur naturaly. ,Rebuttal
"which caused for another search to get an even clearer picture, which was not easy. The photo obtained on April 8, 2001 was a phenomenal photo, which proved the face on mars to be a mesa, nothing but a happy accident, you could say.",Rebuttal
which is absurd. A discovery like that of an ancient alien civilization on Mars would benefit NASA.,Rebuttal
These kinds of thoughts always happen because of the media. ,Rebuttal
but in reality its just an illusion that it happeing with the stars and everything within space. ,Rebuttal
"Even though many people wanted to beleive there was life on Mars(including NASA) they had to stick to the evidence.
",Rebuttal
"""Well Robert they actually went back for a better photo in fact a ten times shaper photo than the original one"". ",Rebuttal
 but that is not true ,Rebuttal
"We first uploaded these images onto a JPL website, explaining that the Face was a natural landform and that it was not a monument built by aliens. ",Rebuttal
"This image shows that the Face is an equivalent of a butte or mesa. This is a common landform on Earth, and proves that the Face on Mars is just an oddly shaped area of land.
",Rebuttal
"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.",Rebuttal
"The answer is we don't know exactly what formed it, but our research shows that it is a natural landform.",Rebuttal
"Yes that could be true, but our research and pictures also prove it to be wrong. The first snapshot of the Face was captured was a long time ago. Since then our camera and photo quality has improved ",Rebuttal
"Once again, that cannot be true because the characteristics and qualities of the Face look exactly like a part of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. ",Rebuttal
 That cannot be true becasue if the aliens were hidden we would not have such a great picture of the faces. That completly shows that there is proof that this face is just a natural landform. ,Rebuttal
"Neverthless, on April 8, 2001 on a couldless day the we tried for a third time,",Rebuttal
"But then on April 8 , 2001 almost 3 years later - a cloudless summer day, Mars Global Surveyor drew close to the ""Face on Mars"" they had to ""roll 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view"" said Gravin.",Rebuttal
",but they are not real and they didn't.",Rebuttal
but Im just telling the truth. ,Rebuttal
"But Im sorry to be the bear of bad news, but it is also the truth. ",Rebuttal
"This is what many people thought for years, but finally the truth came out.
",Rebuttal
 but so did the rock in my uncle's back yard. All the thoughts of it being an alien is so made up in their heads. ,Rebuttal
but that doesn't make it a fact. ,Rebuttal
there are more facts to prove that its a natural landform ,Rebuttal
but there is no reason to.,Rebuttal
"This led to NASA going out of their way to get a better shot of it, hopeing that this will silence the doubters,",Rebuttal
As stated before this has no foundation because if Intelegent life was found on Mars if would only benifit NASA by drumming up a lot of money for research. Meaning the theory is unlikely. ,Rebuttal
"This wouldn't be the case, considering that there are no clear signs of life on mars currently.",Rebuttal
but there is so much more proof you would need to prove it. Just think to your self how could you have proved that it was made by aliens? What proof do you have ,Rebuttal
"it it's really just a landmark on Mars. Yes there may be conspiracys and theories about how this rock or face was made, but there may not be any facts to prove it completly.
",Rebuttal
"but I belive not because not one person has found an alien that was alive.

Aliens have been a myth for quite some time now and no one has really ever seen one. ",Rebuttal
but I do know that it was not made by aliens.,Rebuttal
"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars. ",Rebuttal
 it revealed that it was just a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all,Rebuttal
"To prove everyone wrong, on a cloudless day they took a second photo with even better quality of the landform. ",Rebuttal
" there isn't enough credible evidence that the Face was made by aliens. As I have already said, landforms such as that MArtian mesa are common on Cydonia. This one just happened to look like a face due to the shadows casted onto it. ",Rebuttal
"Why would NASA hide groundbreaking news like this? ""Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was anceint civilazation on Mars.""

So why would NASA hide news like this, that would help advance space exploration?",Rebuttal
"Like in paragraph 9, some mission controllers prepared to look again. Thats when I was like ''no'' theres no reason to send out another spacecraft just to say that its just and natural landform. ",Rebuttal
"However, in the 2001 photo of the Face there was no other evidence of life on Mars (paragraph 11). Also, the Face is considered a mesa which are very common on Mars (paragraph 3).Therefore these peoples' theories are not true. ",Rebuttal
"don't you get that, they could have perfectly normal things just like the Earth that happen every day. Do you understand now?",Rebuttal
 but you see it was ten times as sharper than it had been years before.,Rebuttal
"you never know though, but we don't make it over the face very often, it's hard to get a better view from it. ",Rebuttal
"I know its in the late ninety's but it wen tto a Jet Propulsion Lab where the face started to apppear into a face. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common arounf Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptain Pharoh.",Rebuttal
"However, the monument wasn't actually made by aliens, it was made by natural events. ",Rebuttal
" But if NASA had proof of other life forms, they would get more sponsor ship and it would be better for them. ",Rebuttal
But I think that these people are simply grasping for straws. ,Rebuttal
" But I think this is wrong,",Rebuttal
"These people would be very wrong. If NASA found life on Mars, then they would get millions of people's attention. ",Rebuttal
In 2001 another picture that was not fogged was tooken and put an end to the entire fuss. ,Rebuttal
but u also got to think about how land andother things can form tier self in to living fetures like for some exsample. ,Rebuttal
until 2001 when they took the final picture and they saw that it was actually a landform Garvin said that it reminded he of snake river of Idaho. ,Rebuttal
"is just wrong. The theorists still don't have enough evidence to prove it is a real life face, and that it was created by aliens. ",Rebuttal
"Well, there are actually plenty of reasons why it is just a normal landform with unusual shadows. ",Rebuttal
"Even though the picture clearly showed that the Face wasn't a man-made structure,",Rebuttal
"Then again thats just a bunch of non-sense. If scientist did find another place where living creatures could live, that would be a big discovery. Too big to even hide. ",Rebuttal
but in reality finding other forms of life would benefit many studies and researchers. ,Rebuttal
"Blaming NASA for lying about the discovery of ""aliens"" is just simply illogical.",Rebuttal
but they need to look at the fact that NASA would love that and would benefit form finding alien life.,Rebuttal
These people have absolutly no evidence to support that claim.,Rebuttal
but no this is just a mesa but since people say that stuff we had to prove them wrong.,Rebuttal
But there not its just a rock. ,Rebuttal
Skeptics did not realise that NASA would benifit monumentaly from the discovery of an ancient alien monument on the surface of mars. ,Rebuttal
"depsite how hard it is to position it to take another picture they did it anyway and it looked nothing like a face, But more like a mountain.
",Rebuttal
Well yes It is very far away but the picture was taken in maxium resilution.,Rebuttal
Well my next reason is NASA would benefit by finding aliens on mars. In the text it said that while defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an alien civillzation,Rebuttal
", it just rocks and lava. There are so many reason why its not. Just read on and you will find out why I think this way.
",Rebuttal
But you will need evidence to prove that.,Rebuttal
"So people wanted to have a clearer image since the picture had to be taken through a layer of clouds. Finding the Face on Mars wasn't an easy job, but we found it again and snapped a thrid picture in April of 2001. This certain picture showed that it was just another Mesa.",Rebuttal
"That makes even less sense then saying that aliens created it in the first place! If we could find something that was really built by aliens, that would be tremedously great for us.",Rebuttal
the face does look like it but no it is a natural artifact ,Rebuttal
 it was not made by aliens. ,Rebuttal
but as of right not there is no evidence that they do. ,Rebuttal
"Us scientist had describe the icon which resembles a human head . its formed bve shawdows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and a mouth. This have attracted alot of people attention to Mars. ",Rebuttal
you would have no clue that there's no reason for us to hide life being on Mars ,Rebuttal
"However, there's not enough evidence to prove this sign of life on Mars. ",Rebuttal
"The face on Mars is nothing but land that has been formed in the shape of a face.
",Rebuttal
"Only because we don't actually know if there are aliens ,but in the end its just lava that created this dome like face. ",Rebuttal
" but that's just how the natural landform is. The picture was actually showing us a butte or mesa, which is a landform that is common around the American West.",Rebuttal
"However, with art or sign, they would live near the structure, but there are no sign of a life around the area. Also, it is not reasonable to believe what the conspiracy theorists are stating ",Rebuttal
but if that was true NASA wouldn't hide it. ,Rebuttal
" but there were many diferent pictures taken. NASA was able to take several photos at many different times, so there would be no way that they missed something. ",Rebuttal
Sceintist have taken pictures to prove that it was a natural landform and their were no signs of alliens ,Rebuttal
"but after many scientists researching and exploring the ""face"" they clearly stated ""this face reminds us most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plan of Idaho."" ",Rebuttal
That could be true but in this case I do not think so ,Rebuttal
"I think that ultimately this is just a coincidence because if aliens are real or were real we would have got aa picture of one or saw some remains of one. And the rock is probably just a mesa or a big landform that was made by weathering and erosion. The face of the rock is most likely just shadows from the camera angle and the sun. And another thing, when the camera passed over the mesa, it was a cloudy and rainy day, making the camera lens wet. ",Rebuttal
But the truth is we don't we want you to know everything we know and we want to find any sign of alien life like artifacts and shacks and technology ,Rebuttal
"The picture was clear perfect nothing could have told you that, that was an alien face.",Rebuttal
"You can make up myths and say that its an alien face, but all the facts say that its just a land form. The land form that looks like a face. It is the ""face"" that helped NASA look closer at there pictures and work on there camera work.",Rebuttal
 even though the alien thing has a good point the pictures that Viking 1 and 2 got show that there are no alien markings ,Rebuttal
So you are saying if I go out to the middle of the desert and see a face it camre from aliens. It is a natural landmark that came with the planet of Mars. NASA is not even telling people so no one even knows for sure anyways. ,Rebuttal
"Although the picture does show a human-like face in the structure, they took another picture in 1998 showing that it is just a landform. Also, in the article, a man named Garvin states that he has saw similar landforms that look like the Face around the American West. ",Rebuttal
"Also stated in paragraph 5, is that the defenders of NASA wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars. ",Rebuttal
"Although a few number of people think it is an alien artifact, it's actually not.",Rebuttal
"So Malin and his team, took another picture they discovered that the landforms were actaully common to a landform in America. ",Rebuttal
"Although, that wasn't the case. Only a few scientist thought the Face was an alien artifact. The other scientist thought it was just something like a rock that happened to look like a face, because of the shadows. ",Rebuttal
Scientist took this theory into thought. Mission controllers stated another spacecraft to send again,Rebuttal
On a cloudless summer day MGS drew close enough for a second look ,Rebuttal
After that on paragraph nine mission controller looked at the face again,Rebuttal
"but perhaps the haze was instead covering up detail in the landform that would show that it is not a face, nor an alien monument, but instead just a natural landform.",Rebuttal
"This may be true,but you can also clearly see the shadows that made it look like a face. ",Rebuttal
"i mean ow could such a puniy creater make such a fuse over a interesting face. Aliens are not real!!

When Fred was rantting about how it had to be an alien and nothing else could have made thoose faces i was thinking that he might have gone crazy",Rebuttal
" Yet, why would NASA cover it up.",Rebuttal
"So on April 8, 2001 it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia and the Global Mars Surveyor got a second chance to look at the butte. The surveyor took a photo using its cameras absolute maximum resolution. The picture showed that it was just a Martian equivalent of a butte or a messa. ",Rebuttal
"however, it is just a landform",Rebuttal
"If anyone is thinking that same thing, I can see why you may think that, but there is simply no scientific evidence to support your opinion.",Rebuttal
while NASA says they wish there was a ancient alien civilation on Mars.,Rebuttal
"However, new pictures were taken and shows that if there was alien markings, they would have been noticed which goes to show that the face is a natural landform.
",Rebuttal
This is not true. ,Rebuttal
now many people dont talk about this topic alot any more because it has been proven that it was just a landform created by the plates moving on mars,Rebuttal
Most of these claims lack evidence. ,Rebuttal
"but the facts just don't prove that to be true, therefore it is indeed just a natural landform. ",Rebuttal
"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" Yes we could be hiding it from you for their sake not ours, so before you think that we're hiding things from you for us think about the aliens too. ",Rebuttal
to disprove this they took a better picture in the summer ,Rebuttal
"Then on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for a second look. The text states ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" This proves that if there were any Egyptian like pyramids or any alien type monument, you would be able to see it.   ",Rebuttal
"This is a pretty strange argumental topic, as people who believe this stuff anyway will hardly be convinced by a random scientist at NASA.",Rebuttal
"Well, that point can actually be rebuted as well, because of what Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixer size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"". Factually that should be the end of it, it was a clear picture, that was enhanced for farther detail, on a clear day, with a high resolution camera. ",Rebuttal
"Here is the other side to the point I just made, think about this rationally for a second, could aliens really have made a monument or some strange thing on Mars, only for it to be found by humans?",Rebuttal
"So,on April 8,2001 another photo was taken. This time a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. Mars Global Surveyor used a camera that had each pixel span 1.56 meters. ",Rebuttal
there could be but there are no studys to prove that there is life.,Rebuttal
There are many ways that we could prove that aliens DID NOT create this fasinating landform,Rebuttal
"but this is not true. We as scientists wish to share information on space with the public, but we will not spread false rumors about alien lifeforms when there are none. ",Rebuttal
Dont believe this because its slightly untrue because if you believe that aliens are real then of course your going to believe that aliens have came and put this face on mars.,Rebuttal
"where defenders of the NASA budget ""wish there was an ancient civilization on mars.",Rebuttal
"but, thats not logical. ",Rebuttal
"but, that could just be the way the planet is getting light and reflected by the sun. ",Rebuttal
" Because of the outstanding resoluation of the photo, it then again proved that it was simply anatural landform and that aliens did not play a part in it's creation. ",Rebuttal
"NASA try their best to get better shots to prove if it was an alien artifact or not , We felt this was important to taxpayers, said Jim Garvin .
",Rebuttal
Even though NASA and it's supporters said they would have wanted it to be alien. ,Rebuttal
It would be a giant step in discovery and extremely exciteing if these ideas came to be true but unfortunatly they haven't . ,Rebuttal
"Well on April 8, 2001, a spacecraft went over the face on a clear day and got a picture.",Rebuttal
 Those people do no evidence which makes it hard to believe. ,Rebuttal
"I mean think about about it, why would we hide evidence that would benefit this whole organization? Most of the people here at NASA wish that there was an early civilization on Mars. If we did find life on Mars we would share it world wide, it would be one of the greates scientic breakthroughs in history.
",Rebuttal
"In 2001, on a ""cloudless summer day"". Mars Global Surveyor got another look. The photo was taken in maxium resolution. ""Each pixels in the 2001 images spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.""
",Rebuttal
"But I doubt they would make a face print in a planet to get our attention. Plus, there are other weird, yet amazing, artifacts in the universe that no one can forget.",Rebuttal
"Could aliens make rock? Rock natrually happens for alot of reasons but, aliens isn't one of them ! Is there any proven facts that alliens exsist? No",Rebuttal
Yet the lack of evidence says that they don't exist. ,Rebuttal
"To ""sculpt"" this landform, the aliens would have to dig out surrounding land, and that is hard, not impossible, but hard to do ",Rebuttal
"and to that arguement, I say ""Good job! You are so close to logic!"" because while NASA could cover up the truth, they wouldn't do so.",Rebuttal
"However, it looked like it was a huge rock formation with a human head formed by shawdows. ",Rebuttal
your wrong. If NASA released that there was alien lifeforms on Mars their funding would be increased by a lot. ,Rebuttal
But its a landform growing in a shape of a face if there was different landforms that grew the same way it would be the same way as this landform. Or there coud have bind so bad weather and it could have did this and made the face.,Rebuttal
but NASA's budget defenders wish there was because if there was life on mars then they would get tons of money from the discovery of extraterestrial beings on mars. ,Rebuttal
"However, scientists work on their research really hard, so I believe that they know what are doing and seeing. For example, scientists say that you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so we can see what the face is, a natural butte or mesa. ",Rebuttal
Still NASA went on a third trip to make its point. This time they used their most advanced camera yet and took crystal clear pictures of the Face. ,Rebuttal
But why would NASA want to hide something so extrordinary? Not to mention the fact they would get even more publicity and money spewing their way.,Rebuttal
"So NASA decided to set off one last time. On April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for a second picture, this time with even better cameras.",Rebuttal
No because Mars has many natural disasters such as eruptions and Mars quakes,Rebuttal
"But, there is some information to make you want to believe it. ",Rebuttal
" But, the photos that were taken make it clear that there is no way the unusual Face was made by aliens.",Rebuttal
"On the other hand, this couldn't be true because aliens could easily still cover the formation, but that didn't happen because the scientist ended up taking realistic photos of the face rock. ",Rebuttal
I argue that the Face wasn't created by aliens but from natural landforms. ,Rebuttal
If the trip or service is a success than the company might want the school to come back in the future. The students would be glad that they get to get out of school for a while. The staff would be glad for the kids not getting on their nerves all day. ,Rebuttal
But that is no reason to not help out the community for one day! ,Rebuttal
"but afterwards you get this good tingling feeling. You feel like your actions and what you do can reflect this world. Along with your feelings, imagine how much warmth the other people that you're helping feel. They probably will grin as bright as a light bulb, ",Rebuttal
"but really it doesn't , the community service can be during school hours , or on your weekend while doing the things you normally do  ",Rebuttal
"But, if you require for them to do community service, you could be helping them realize it's not all about them and giving back is something great and they should be doing it more often.",Rebuttal
"but it will make a big difference. Community service wont take up your time .
",Rebuttal
there are so many more ways that they can help out. ,Rebuttal
they should know that it really helps people out. ,Rebuttal
helping others is just a very amazing thing to do.,Rebuttal
But you have to give the students a chance to make their own decisions as what to do for extracurricular activities. ,Rebuttal
But what i' m getting to is that community service would be a great idea for everyone to do. ,Rebuttal
but you cant force people who just don't have the time. ,Rebuttal
"But, what about what the children want?",Rebuttal
"But doing community service can grant you awards, prizes, etc.
",Rebuttal
but some people just don't have the time for it. ,Rebuttal
I don't agree with them because they might be lazy and don't care about how our town looks. ,Rebuttal
you don't have to make them do it only the kids that want to volunteer.,Rebuttal
"it doesn't, you need to do something positive in life, you should be glad to do something positive. ",Rebuttal
"Well, teaching kids to go out of their way and help others now will create habits to help others when they are an adult.
",Rebuttal
"Well it really doesn't take up that much time. Usually i am required to do a certain amount of community service for beta club or by my parents. I always have time still for dance, soccer, friends, homework, surfing, and afters school activity's and I'm a busy person.

Kids can use that excuse but really it doesn't take up that much time.",Rebuttal
"not the people that work as hard as they possibly can all day and barley have their eight hours of rest shouldn't be doing it the ""other guys should"". ",Rebuttal
"But others feel strongly about making a change or difference in where they live, and keeping everything clean and organized. I myself like to do community service because it makes me feel good about myself that I can effect someone's life in a good manner, but not everyone is like me",Rebuttal
"But, at school level ages, children cannot recognize these aspects of life or appreciate them. ",Rebuttal
 But I would tell them if I can find time so can you.,Rebuttal
You don't need to spend hours but only a minute to help someone out.,Rebuttal
But what some of the students at the school needs to realize is that even if your friends may think that your crazy for doing it is not always about what your friends may think. Some of the times a friend my not know what` s best for you. And I say if you think that it would make a difference in one persons life then it was all worth it. And no matter what every person wants to live in a safe and also clean place no matter were you may go.,Rebuttal
" they should also recognize that some people unable to do the same, and need the help. ",Rebuttal
i think there is time for everything. and students should always take part in anything that would make their community better and cleaner.,Rebuttal
If they need it they will know deep down inside that they do,Rebuttal
"when the air is polluted, and more people get sick per week or day from it, it is time to start cleaning up are community",Rebuttal
"but they need to learn that they can save the environment by just picking up a wrapper on the ground, and spending time away from the electronics, and go outside with friends, or pick up trash in their neighborhood. ",Rebuttal
they are not forced to give up their time. People who don't want to do community service shouldn't have to.,Rebuttal
but someday day they will look back at the day they did community service and thank their principal for requiring them to do that. ,Rebuttal
it would be good to have everybody helping out their community,Rebuttal
"First of all, we're just sitting down mostly our days watching TV and computer games. This would actually help us get to know more people, and be more social. Also, depending on what we're volunteering for, also a good work-out. ",Rebuttal
but education is more important because it will help u get into college and help make money to support your family.,Rebuttal
"but unfortunately, we do not.",Rebuttal
"but i think that if each student does community service that maybe we could raffle a prize out every month or so, so that they could get motivated to do the service. ",Rebuttal
"I understand, but that still doesn't make it right. If someone ends up there well so be it. You can't stop that but why make kids especially our age do something that we don't need to and have no business doing ",Rebuttal
Now you know at least one student wants it.,Rebuttal
"But if they all help in community service it may help them a long the road to keep a cleaner environment, and have a good say about your self for good jobs. ",Rebuttal
really they are still learning,Rebuttal
but it help me realize to take pride in where I live and make it look better. Not many people do that now a days. ,Rebuttal
but its for a good cause !,Rebuttal
We should inspire them to help. ,Rebuttal
but the obviously have enough time to watch television or go on the internet. So they should be required to do community service.,Rebuttal
but it really doesn't if you actually do it for a certain amount of time. ,Rebuttal
"However i do not agree with students must or be forced to do community service, i think it should be a self choice on whether they want to do community service or not. ",Rebuttal
"There are many things you can do for community service and they will find something they like! You just have to push them to get started. That is all they really need, is a little push start.",Rebuttal
but i tell her its important to help the community,Rebuttal
the students are still giving back to their community and staying active- two very important things in life!,Rebuttal
But in reality it only takes up a few days a year of an average persons life. ,Rebuttal
But if they never know the feeling of accomplishment when it comes to that. ,Rebuttal
"I admit that I do that to over some weekends, but showing kids that they can make a difference will give them the ability to get off the couch and go help the community. There will be a significantly larger amount of kids that help the community. Though it may not be a significant amount of help, it's better than no help.",Rebuttal
but I really think it would be a great idea for the school to meet up with some people that do community service and offer to have people to come and help them with it. They could possibly come weekly or even monthly and take a group of students out and do whatever they need them to help with. ,Rebuttal
"but, why be watching t. v when you could go help clean up litter to make a better environment for us.",Rebuttal
but they will thank you for it latter. This is a great opportunity.  ,Rebuttal
"help someone change theirs. How would you feel if you really needed help or wanted to make a change but no one will help you and no one will support you in any way what so ever, what do you think will happen to you if your homeless or don't have enough oxygen because you never tried to plant a tree not a day in your life?
",Rebuttal
it makes the world a better place little by little.,Rebuttal
"In the end, it would be better for them to keep their area clean and healthy, so that they will not get sick. ",Rebuttal
"but the ones who do are not just helping society, they are also helping themselves. ",Rebuttal
Maybe they may not have the time ,Rebuttal
"It would be hard but we could do it, but it will affect the way people live greatly. ",Rebuttal
but will also take away kids after school activities. ,Rebuttal
" I think for people who actually participate and really help out with the community service, they should get a little reward. ",Rebuttal
If we can find a way to get the community service not to interfere with activities other students are participating in I think that this will be a very successful idea.,Rebuttal
Being pushed to your limits is always something that is overlooked.,Rebuttal
but they don't know how it can change your outlook on life.,Rebuttal
but they don't know how fulfilled you feel after you help.,Rebuttal
but really they have time there just to lazy to do it. ,Rebuttal
"It won't happen right away but give it time.

If you are happy and have a good attitude about what will happen to you and someone else is happy because of you then you have done a good job.
",Rebuttal
"But i promise if you just did this like once a month when there is nothing going on I'm sure there would be no problem.

Also even if there was a practice on the schedule, the coach for the team or whatever there is a practice for the he/she wouldn't mind them doing some community work. ",Rebuttal
I feel for this we need to have a limitation for the amount of hours required,Rebuttal
Others don't agree that they should help because they have much bigger requirements they must attend to. ,Rebuttal
but I'm standing by it.,Rebuttal
 but many students choose to do community service voluntarily anyway. ,Rebuttal
"but we should not be required, because a lot of people would probably drop out of school if we were required to do community service. ",Rebuttal
But I think that they say it because they are just lazy. We need to get them out and about teaching children or picking up litter,Rebuttal
 but actually it's not. It's just showing that you do care about your community.,Rebuttal
"But what about those new goer's? A change of schedule can be very frustrating, especially when it means doing your homework late at night. ",Rebuttal
"but what if you have to community service first? Your parents might understand the situation you in, so they'll probably post pone ""clean up"" day to the week end. Which is the only days a student has to forget about their troubles at school.",Rebuttal
but sometimes missing out on things that might be fun to you is worth it in the end.,Rebuttal
"It would show them that there is much more than just being a kid and trying to get away with stuff.
",Rebuttal
but that time is used to help others ,Rebuttal
ut if they do no work or teach a child who's learning to read the wrong way it will take so much more work to help fix what that person has done. ,Rebuttal
That is not true because we do get something from helping out. ,Rebuttal
but it is the right thing to do to help.,Rebuttal
"but its the way to help the earth. Earth is where we live at , with out it what would we be? Human people wouldn't exist with out earth",Rebuttal
In most cases this is a lie.,Rebuttal
 but I think that it is right that everyone has to take part in their community. ,Rebuttal
"However, some of my other friends don't like the idea of community service because it takes away from their free time. ",Rebuttal
I think that community service is very important,Rebuttal
"but I can assure you that community service is greatly needed. It doesn't matter that it may take time away from work or other jobs, we all need to give back now and then. We ,as a community, cant have a ""well-someone-else-should-do-it"" attitude, because if we all thought that then nothing would ever get done ",Rebuttal
" but then you come to realize that it wasn't, probably not as important as helping your community.",Rebuttal
"I am partially in agreement for both suggestions, but I believe a medium can be found.",Rebuttal
You should at least try to help out a little though.,Rebuttal
"I'm just that we should do it out of our own will. It takes personal time away from being with our friends and family while we're not at school, and doing other activities with the ones we love",Rebuttal
"They should have to stay after school, and do things for the school. ",Rebuttal
but in truth these are the lazy failing students that don't want to do anything in life.,Rebuttal
it could also be a bad decision as well.,Rebuttal
but school activities come before social life.,Rebuttal
"but at the end of the day it does, you line in the same community where you have to live as well, so you might as well take care of it too.",Rebuttal
"but its not for them its for the whole community, or maybe you can just let some kids do it. The ones who sign up for it get a prize.",Rebuttal
"I believe that you should leave things the way they are and see what happens from here. Have faith in your students, I am sure that many students will be involved in community service without you forcing them to. And although many of them cannot take part in community service, I am sure that they would love to help if they could.",Rebuttal
but for some people it just takes to much time! ,Rebuttal
but in the long run it will have payed off and kids will be much wiser in the future. ,Rebuttal
"hey should think twice because it can be fun, but it helps a lot in life. It can help the fact that you can do something that helps. ......ALOT! like you can help at home. Earn cash, to buy cleaning supply's. That can help save animals, humans, life. But for the who don't care to help, you should help, do some community service. You can get extra credit, you can help little kids and save animals life's. ",Rebuttal
"In truth, it is extremely important for students to complete community service because it is important to give back to the community.
",Rebuttal
I'm sure we could always do those stuff another day. What's more important? Our community or hanging out with friends? ,Rebuttal
but we should be able to do it when we want to.,Rebuttal
But I don't think we should have to pick up after other students they should pick up after themselves. ,Rebuttal
but at the same time it will make students miserable.,Rebuttal
But also believe that it should be done for the right reason.,Rebuttal
"but what they really should be doing is helping them. They know that doing things for other people, or the community, is the right thing",Rebuttal
some students just do not have the time to do things like that. ,Rebuttal
"Doing little things like walking your neighbors dog, or help babysit your cousins is enough for students who have extracurricular activities, and boat loads of homework. Many students do participate in community service, and many also do extracurricular activities. ",Rebuttal
"doesn't mean that they can't throw in a little extra time for the community. Go to study hall or try to get some of your work done in school, instead of talking.",Rebuttal
You have to know how to manage to keep your grades up and be able to perform in community service.,Rebuttal
but many kids have activities after school so they may not be able to do this.,Rebuttal
but we need to do this for ourselves and the Earth.,Rebuttal
but you will see how helping others can change the world. ,Rebuttal
"Although, I don't think many students would be too happy if they were forced to do this. ",Rebuttal
"Why is the world like this? I know it is simply not because community service is bad. I know for sure that is wrong, or is it because people today are too lazy? Or simply scared of criticism? Yet, we as people must give back to our community, not act as if it were to be a burden.",Rebuttal
but yet again it would have seen a waste to some of the students that are planning on not attending college.,Rebuttal
But we cant leave other people that work all day and all week when they are tiered and want to rest to be picking our left overs!! ,Rebuttal
But a principle someone that you do not even know that well tells you what to do when they don't do that much for you,Rebuttal
If they are a bad kid why would you leave them their alone and you would have to pay a teacher extra to stay their longer.,Rebuttal
but i personally believe that it should be for those who want to ,Rebuttal
"helping the community is doing an act of service, which every student should be able to enjoy.
",Rebuttal
we wouldn't like to make students feel that way. ,Rebuttal
"However, many other students who do not wish to partake have the perspective that community service is time consuming, and unnecessary to complete. ",Rebuttal
well if they just did it for just an hour or 30 min. that would be great. cause 30 min is a lot of time to help but i was just going to tell you i think it is a great idea even if some people don't like the idea i still think you should do it or you should do it for punishment so that they would not get in trouble no more especially if they don't like doing that.,Rebuttal
but when the work is done it looks a lot better,Rebuttal
 but I assure you that once their time is done they will appreciate the satisfaction they receive for taking part in helping to do something that would not be possible without them ,Rebuttal
this shows that we would need to protect the students while they are working.,Rebuttal
"Well to fix that problem, the service should be done in the morning where students have nothing to do, and in the weekends when they have no school.",Rebuttal
 but i don't want to any more i cant stand it.,Rebuttal
but I think if the put forth and effort and participated in it; they would change their minds and come to love it.,Rebuttal
but it really helps our environment and people who need it ,Rebuttal
"Those kids might look lazy and unhealthy, but they are having fun in their own way. ",Rebuttal
but you are forcing them to do it ,Rebuttal
doesn't mean u could do little work.,Rebuttal
But it's just not fair for the ones who would like to do something else besides community work. Or for someone who has other things to do that involves helping other people.,Rebuttal
And then all you have to do from there is just sit down and talk with them during an assembly or whatever just to get them motivated. ,Rebuttal
They are just too lazy to stand up for themselves and finally do something right for the community.,Rebuttal
But have they ever thought about what a better community they would live in if they did community service?,Rebuttal
What these people do not realize is that they still will have time for these things.,Rebuttal
however they're times when you can't unchanged something.,Rebuttal
however if they want a activity that someone else has they can't do it.,Rebuttal
but when they realize they are working together to help the community they should feel better about themselves ,Rebuttal
that's okay! Having the litter plan for a different group to go every day can fix that.,Rebuttal
"but students usually see their friends in school, after school or on the weekends. They use their phone to communicate with others and keep in touch. ",Rebuttal
"they don't think about others, they think only for themselves. And that can lead to a life of crime, with selfish desires for what others have. ",Rebuttal
"There should be a catch to this, for example: anyone that does 10 hours a month will get a pizza party with a movie. These kinds of things will persuade a person to want to volunteer.

At the end of the year, everyone who did more than 50 hours will go to Six Flags for all the effort they put in. ",Rebuttal
but do teenagers really need community service? Sooner or later teenagers will figure out how to become better people. Its all part of growing up. Let your students grow up. ,Rebuttal
"They might change overtime because they see how bad some peoples life is, and that they should be thankful that they have a good life. So they could help them even more.",Rebuttal
It only takes an hour or so to help clean up the neighborhood or give a homeless person food or clothing.,Rebuttal
but I think if everyone participates it wouldn't be so hard. We could also find a way for them like do it twice a day or schedule a time so they can do they can do what they need to do. ,Rebuttal
"But, not every child has parents that are able to take them to do their community service because most parents work. ",Rebuttal
to me it would be about finding myself and finding who i want to be.,Rebuttal
"But if it is required then that takes away from it being a good deed.
",Rebuttal
"but they really aren't trivial at all. They don't realize it, but they could be making a big difference in someone's life. I don't know how many times I've heard that we were put here to help others, and i know a lot of other kids have heard it, too. Well, this is our chance to help those others. This is our chance to brighten up somebody's day. This is our chance to make a difference. ",Rebuttal
these kids may like community service and do not know it because they have not tried it. ,Rebuttal
but it is fun when you see what you did and people with happy faces it makes me feel happy inside. ,Rebuttal
f you require for all students to take part in this community service it will allow them to become responsible and reliable adults ,Rebuttal
Extra credit could be offered as a way to help motivate students ,Rebuttal
 is ridiculous if you didn't have a community then you wouldn't be playing sports or going to your community pool. ,Rebuttal
"What do the mean, if it wasn't for the community the wouldn't be doing anything.
",Rebuttal
but some students do not want to do it and some have sports or other things to worry about and i just think it could cause so much stress to students.,Rebuttal
 but on the other hand children and young adults like me have much free time normally wasted watching television. ,Rebuttal
" it really isn't. While they pick up litter, they will be around friends and enjoying themselves, while getting the job done. Or while they tutor a child, they will be enhancing their ability to get along with a child for babysitting job as a teen and will also be preparing for their future as a parent.

",Rebuttal
but at least they tried it and helped out a little. It's a good chance to take if some of the students will actually like helping and they'll do it again and again and they even get their friends to come help next time.,Rebuttal
In my personal opinion there is no point on making students that don't want to help people or their community do community service at all unless they do something that is actually bad and have no other choice. ,Rebuttal
"I wont lie it does take some time, but some kids spend weekends doing nothing. Community service has a lot of options that they can choose from. Some kids like to ride bikes, so they can consider Meals-On -Wheels. Later when they start working at a fast food restaurant they can deliver the food.",Rebuttal
o i told her to waste your time why don't you go and pick up the trash at the beach.,Rebuttal
But that is how they are living their lives; it's their lifestyle.,Rebuttal
but they can think what they want to think and so can I.,Rebuttal
but you have to take in mind that there may be a priority greater to some students than having to volunteer their time towards the community when they have other more important things to do,Rebuttal
It doesn't matter who you are or what race you are it matter about everyone coming together as a family. ,Rebuttal
"But it should be in school time since a person only has one life to live, and they better make the best of it. ",Rebuttal
 but to be successful in the job market these day you want to be a hard working individual who doesn't mind doing something for others. ,Rebuttal
 but what is better than trying to make our environment cleaner and nicer?,Rebuttal
"If they want to make excuses, maybe you could have them do a couple more hours of work. And for the

Because students are fully capable of doing good for their community",Rebuttal
"there are subjects to consider. Such as, knowing if the parent able to afford some body better or that if they can trust a stranger with their kids.",Rebuttal
the reality is that people these days are very LAZY so we should have a choice on what we do after school.,Rebuttal
"That's one of those things that makes me happy, I just wish that I could take a break once in a while. Seeing new people every day, with smiles on their faces, makes a smile on mine.",Rebuttal
" but I'm also a teen age girl. I like to do stuff with my friends, go to the movies, or mall. Some times I just like to chill at home and not think about the hours I have to do. ",Rebuttal
Others cannot find the time for it. ,Rebuttal
maby they will have time in school ,Rebuttal
"then that's understandable, but if its because you promised to hang with your friends that's no reason.",Rebuttal
life in my eyes has to have a little responsibility and in what better way than to help other people in community service. ,Rebuttal
"When it is not a waste, and could also help them out. ",Rebuttal
That is not the case however. It is just something that would really help out the world and plays a major role in many lives. ,Rebuttal
that is why I would highly recommend community service instead of forcing it.,Rebuttal
"I say that if you make them do something they don't want to do, the end results probably wont be commendable. I also say that if you give them a good and fun reason to do it they most likely will. ",Rebuttal
"But what about the students that don't have time to help out.
",Rebuttal
"I suggest not forcing it upon the students to perform in this act, but encourage them to lend a helping hand as much as possible! Maybe you could reward them in some way, such as lunch with the teachers, or five extra minutes at recess every Friday. That may be hard for you to adjust, so if you could reason to give them extra credit for their actions, then I'm sure that will be enough to get a great community started!",Rebuttal
"but research shows that 90% of students that perform community service will be doing themselves and there neighborhoods good !

Experts agree that doing community service will help the world ! ",Rebuttal
 Then there are some that will. So we have to come together and make this happen ,Rebuttal
But in reality the kids are going to feel that they are being punished. ,Rebuttal
because its not ,Rebuttal
"We can explain to them how they can complete their homework, do sports and other things and still do community service. We can give them tips on how to manage time and be responsible.",Rebuttal
" But if they decide to help ,they can do it! Explain how It will help you become a better person, you will get to help others and that will make you feel good about yourself. Tell them that its a fun thing to do its better than just staying home and do nothing or just hangout with friends when you could do that another day. ",Rebuttal
" but in my case, and many others, after-school sports and activities help my focus during the school day. ",Rebuttal
but we all need to step up and help out the community. ,Rebuttal
what they don't know is community service doesn't always have to be something big that takes a lot of time out of there day. They can pick up trash around their neighborhood for 10 or 15 minutes a day.,Rebuttal
" So if you can't force them to do it then how can you get them to do community service?

Encouragement is the answer.",Rebuttal
"but if everyone would just spend an hour a day or even a week to help out our community by picking up trash, tutoring students, helping the elderly, and helping at local stores think of what we could achieve. Our community would be a much better place to live in.",Rebuttal
I actually think community service is a good thing to have. Some students clean up litter around are community and some students tutor elementary school children. All of these things are good and really make a difference in our community. Community service is a good way to help out in our community. It helps how are community functions. ,Rebuttal
Helping the people in South Carolina is better than any sport or video game. Those things don't help our state become beautiful helping the community is. ,Rebuttal
but some just don't have the time.,Rebuttal
"However, do you not agree that at least some work is required, at least on the community's behalf?",Rebuttal
but it's something that should be done not only for the community but for themselves. ,Rebuttal
but it helps you out in the long run. ,Rebuttal
but they don't do it either way. Let's get them off their couches and into the community ,Rebuttal
but it would be a way of teaching them to do good not only for themselves but also for others who do appreciate and want to feel good for what they do. ,Rebuttal
"There is different things we can do though. Instead of ""making"" people do community service. We could have a chart over a year and the child has to do so many hours of service can get credits for graduation.",Rebuttal
"should stop woring about it becasue it may be boring sometimes or fun, but they should just know that we are doing this for a good cause by helping the community with feeding and clothing the homeless, helping out sick and needy kids that are at the Children's Hospital, helping with the MRDD children at their school, at the dog shelter, etc. ",Rebuttal
'm not judging because some activities do in my opinion take to long. Maybe I could suggest some other things that those kids could do. ,Rebuttal
but some kids are busy or do not have the time to help out ,Rebuttal
" But other students want to sit around and be lazy and you don't want sluggish students do you, I don't.",Rebuttal
 but shouldn't be required at least you should wait until the kids are a senior in H.S. to start require community service.,Rebuttal
"but this isn't something that has to be done everyday, once a week, is better than nothing. ",Rebuttal
Yet if we tell the students that community service can be doing the simplest thing. I'm sure they couldn't deny it. ,Rebuttal
 but its worth it in the long run.,Rebuttal
there may be some that are and it would be a good thing to have these opportunities available for them to take in consideration of participating in ,Rebuttal
but remember if they don't or if they do they do its not our choice if they want to live in a bad or good community their the ones that want to be dirty and disgusting people not us. ,Rebuttal
 but they have to learn what our community needs.,Rebuttal
it would not be waste of time when you get to know how our community can be a better place for us. ,Rebuttal
"but when get to know what our community is, they would want to know about and would want to participate and know why is our community important",Rebuttal
But that is a great way to help world. ,Rebuttal
"but they should still make some time to volunteer, even if its not huge, they could collect food for a food bank or something small ",Rebuttal
"Littering is a foul habit for a lot of people, most people don't realize how bad it damages our community and pollution.",Rebuttal
We need to help them understand that the only way things are going to change are by the acts of others. ,Rebuttal
"But by doing community services each of us is doing something subsidiary. I think if we all do this we can make our community a better place to live in and i assure your that after doing so many good and helpful things toward others, in the end you will feel and be a better person. ",Rebuttal
they have never really tried it.,Rebuttal
you also need the good grades to,Rebuttal
"but not everyone is perfect. Plus, being in an activity or sport can really help sharpen the brain. Remind kids once in a while to bring up there grade, but don't make a policy. It just isn't fair for everyone.",Rebuttal
"But, once they get there grades up they will be fine.
",Rebuttal
"But for the kids that do care they're just not getting the material that we are learning, why should they be punished to.",Rebuttal
 it may also make some just give up and not even try to do sports and after school activities. ,Rebuttal
But that will just stress them even more.,Rebuttal
but grades should come first in a persons life! ,Rebuttal
But we also have to push our student athletes to exceed in everything they do.,Rebuttal
but if I could decide to do this or not I probably say no because it would give people excuses to sit at home and do absolutely nothing and play video games all day. ,Rebuttal
but not every student is not entirely great at their academic studies ,Rebuttal
"I totally agree but on the same terms you want us scholars to have marvelous academic rates. But it's unremarkable, how well this school has changed we have all tried to succeed and put our greatest foot in front of us.",Rebuttal
"but i also feel that many students may not feel a need to keep their average at a grade C because without sport eligibility, there is no need to. There is also the issue of coaches losing their jobs because there are not enough children to play that sport. ",Rebuttal
"
My suggestion is the following: Students with an A or B average will definitely be allowed to participate in any kind of school activity.

Students with a C average will be allowed to perform certain activities but not all. If they show improvement then they will be free to enjoy any activity they like.",Rebuttal
 I know of others who would be devastated by this new rule. ,Rebuttal
" I think it would help people both in the short and long term, and should definitely be carried out in the school.",Rebuttal
 but they get help on their work so they can participate in the activities they want to be in.,Rebuttal
If you was to change the school policy to a C average that make a lot more kids not try to do anything in classes and in school and just mess up a lot of things these days.,Rebuttal
"but the truth is that would really hurt their future. the reason it would hurt them is because if you allow them electives the will get a certain thought stuck in their head that they will live by and that is ""Hey I can get a lot of bad grades and I'm still invincible. ",Rebuttal
"Students can't play because of their grades and the teams will be small or there won't be any teams at all but, this is the price students have to pay to be able to compete in sports and have good grades.
",Rebuttal
"Still, to live a healthy and well-rounded life, one must have the options to participate in activities other than school work. ",Rebuttal
I'm on both sides but i think it would be best to have a C average because a lot of people have trouble and they really want to do sports.,Rebuttal
"but if they want to play a sport that has nothing to do with playing sports.
",Rebuttal
"But, if you would like your students to try and work more efficently and coopretively, then this policy could be the right the thing to enforce in the school.",Rebuttal
"What they don't know is that student loose most of their weight at school,",Rebuttal
they should have a C going to a B,Rebuttal
but sports in what I am trying to get a scholarship in. ,Rebuttal
Can we put this into effect after play-offs?,Rebuttal
"You are not going to be the star of every game that doesn't mean that you shouldn't play right? Same way in the class, ",Rebuttal
but if they cant get a B in college they don't play so its just preparing them for that. ,Rebuttal
but if people saw that they were just trying to help then this wouldn't be a problem.      ,Rebuttal
"Well that's too bad. Like I said, students need to earn it. I don't care if the team will perform poorly without the star player. This might motivate them to do better in school, and then everyone will win.",Rebuttal
"Change that pattern. If your parents aren't that smart, then you become smart, so that your kids will be smart. ",Rebuttal
"I strongly disagree and believe that if we had the new rule a lot of students will buckle down on their grades in order to play.
",Rebuttal
In that case coaches can arrange time after practice or in the mornings to get extra study time. ,Rebuttal
but that won't change most students. Some students won't even care if you take their sports away and the wont care about their grades either. Most students averaging a C probably don't care about their grades anyways. So really your not helping at all. ,Rebuttal
What if some kids try there hardest and still cant get a b average and have a c average.,Rebuttal
but i think its not .This policy may can change a kid or may break one. ,Rebuttal
 it has to be fair,Rebuttal
"but for some, this is the best they can do.",Rebuttal
"it will only be a small percentage that actually work for it. most will think that they just can't do it so they will give up hope and they will most likely have to much free time and will start developing bad habits, and do something stupid and get themselves killed or someone else killed.",Rebuttal
You can't expect that from every single student. ,Rebuttal
"but without sports and exercise the childhood obesity level would skyrocket as it has in the last few years within adults.
",Rebuttal
but it's what needs to be done. ,Rebuttal
"but a lot of the time, they don't get help with it, making harder on them self. ",Rebuttal
but other come on give them a chance to prove to you that they are trying it's just the mertiaral is difficult to understand,Rebuttal
but kids need time to relax and have some fun.,Rebuttal
"but please have in mind that your students will know that you gave them a chance to try and be involved more in school, have fun, and get to be a part of their school's sports team or volunteering club or whatever it is they'd like to be in.",Rebuttal
I know that physical activities are something that help the development of your body. ,Rebuttal
It can be both good and bad. ,Rebuttal
but its unfair for others.,Rebuttal
"but i think its for their own good,",Rebuttal
"but everyone can make at least a B, not an A but a B, because we all are very smart, some smart as others, but yes I'm sure, it will all work out ",Rebuttal
"then that's their lost, because we want our school to be recognized, with all of out players with a B.",Rebuttal
others disagree ,Rebuttal
"Yet, sports and other activities are also very influencing in a child's life. ",Rebuttal
 but this isn't the way to make kids do that.,Rebuttal
but then they also need the right grades to help them maintain the scholarship. ,Rebuttal
 We can find other ways and give our best to help them feel like they should care about what they do at school in the academic field.,Rebuttal
That is why I think that the students should be given two warnings. ,Rebuttal
" that does not mean that only because they have a c average that would not let them enjoy their sports or other activities unless they've a B average.
",Rebuttal
"Then again when I think about it I might not, because I play travel softball year round so therefore I am always playing and may not feel the need to think about staying on the school team that much.",Rebuttal
but you just need to calm you nerves a bit and stop getting so worked up and stuff i know this isn't a nice letter to you but how else would you understand or do you understand ,Rebuttal
"However I don't think this policy should go into affect because what if a student is trying their best in a class, but can't seem to earn a decent grade. What then? Or perhaps the student doesn't have a rather good home life, making it difficult for them to concentrate. ",Rebuttal
"Therefore if they really loved sports and wanted to play in them, then they would try to raise their grade for it.",Rebuttal
"but it might affect the team for those who want to slack off, not even necessarily slack off because a grade C average isn't even failing ",Rebuttal
There also a down fall to that decision. If the policy gets changed will the work get easier?,Rebuttal
" but this is a chance to get kids up and school sports don't last the whole year, they just last for a few months",Rebuttal
 but having problems about schoolwork is hard too,Rebuttal
" I do see that it was a fair decision, because other students push their limits to try and a make a passing grade.",Rebuttal
. If they want a future with sports then they are going to want to put education before sports. ,Rebuttal
"but, I do. Education comes first and if students do not respect that then, they have no reason to play in sports or extracurricular activities ",Rebuttal
definitely most students would think that if they can't play a sport then they better get their work done.,Rebuttal
but some students can't handle that kind of pressure added on to what they've already got going on. ,Rebuttal
"However, it is the job of the public schooling to provide them with the help they need in order to succeed.",Rebuttal
"but I know it will really help us and prepare us for the future.
",Rebuttal
even though they do the percent of them don't make up most of the teams. The teams have different people on them that work in different ways.,Rebuttal
"what they don't say is that the kids should have fun and do what they like to do. Students that can get a middle course grade (a, b, C, d and f) should be able to go out after school and have a fun, disciplined time with their coaches and team mates. ",Rebuttal
. Quitting those other activities would leave our middle school careers with nothing but homework and studying.,Rebuttal
"but school should be more important to these parents who's kids are not achieving a B average.
",Rebuttal
This would probably only happen for a couple of years or sport seasons but after awhile everything would be back to normal and it would be just like anything else in the world and people would begin to grow to the B average rule that the principle has. ,Rebuttal
"its just not fair.
",Rebuttal
"if someone likes to play a sport, then there shouldn't be a change in policy.",Rebuttal
but that's outrageous.,Rebuttal
"But for middle schools without sports programs, such as Cobb County, this would be unfair, ",Rebuttal
but sometimes it just makes students angrier. ,Rebuttal
you can do that along with practicing in sports. But not just sports but other activities as well. ,Rebuttal
Still I support your plan to insure an academically responsible team for all activities ,Rebuttal
but they already do a lot more than an average student.,Rebuttal
"but in return is life fair in any way? life is full of hard challenges that you have to over come, and this will just help some students to over come more things in the future.",Rebuttal
 After a week with limited sports and there is no change in the legal academic grade they should be removed from the active cycle. This method can come in handy when working with not only adults but children also.,Rebuttal
"No, that is not entirely true. A way to fix this predicament is to have consequences and tutors.",Rebuttal
The only problem is that some people will have trouble trying to learn and will have to play their sports.,Rebuttal
then again the grades might be perfect but the kids citizenship is horrible that's a different story altogether. I under stand why you did this but I think that you should put this into affect after the season is over so the kids have time to adjust to the change right now it seems like its just out of the blue. ,Rebuttal
but no every student is like that though you cant punish the students just because they don't make a B grade average. ,Rebuttal
changing school policy is a bad idea because activities outside of school may be the only thing a child may have to look forward to and it provides children with physical activities that they need. ,Rebuttal
but lets face it you wouldn't have any athletes to help us win championships ,Rebuttal
but so is the need to exercise.,Rebuttal
what if its not their fault what if their trying their best but they don't have any encouragement from their guardians ,Rebuttal
when your this age there are more important things.,Rebuttal
"Its probably because they get to distracted, in playing sports and not doing their work ",Rebuttal
for some people its really hard and well what's wrong with a ''C'' its still passing.,Rebuttal
 but if your an athlete it's going to be harder for you because you won't have as much time as the people that are not playing sports.,Rebuttal
"But, it also has a chance to have a bad effect on the students education. If the students are so into their activities that they care more about said activities than their education they could be effected by the previously stated bad change. That bad change is the students dropping out. ",Rebuttal
I also believe more strongly in people doing what they are passionate about in the future. ,Rebuttal
"but when you take away something that a person has a love for, it may do the opposite of improving grades. ",Rebuttal
 but i think all of our opinions on this are close to the same and just as valid as vote for the president to me. ,Rebuttal
 but not every kid has a GPA of 4.0,Rebuttal
but in my opinion it should be left alone.,Rebuttal
"It takes a lot of motivation to get out and run on your own.
",Rebuttal
"but its worth working hard to earn it.
",Rebuttal
"but a C is a passing grade but what if i tried out, so happens a made it, they same I'm one of the best cheerleaders on the squad then they check my grades and see that i have a 75% in science and a 78% in Social Studies those grades would be easy to bring up. But why take me off the team if I'm a great player? But then you let someone on the team with a 79% basically a high C, not a B though yet. Now that wouldn't be fair would it?",Rebuttal
"To the naysayer I

say this stud went my try their hardest at certain things and the best they might earn is a C.",Rebuttal
" its not they best or most affective way. Teenage students that are involved with drugs or gangs will not play the sport any longer because they don't care about school, and find it to hard ",Rebuttal
"They have to improve their grades to get what they want. And if they don't want to, then they shouldn't be allowed in sports. ",Rebuttal
but without sports the kids would be less active and therefore there would be an increase in the obesity rates.,Rebuttal
"your wrong. Us kids are a bunch of lazy people today and if you do this things aren't going to change, they might even get worse",Rebuttal
but a C i nothing.,Rebuttal
"The only problem is that not al students are capable or even that motivated to become a B average student and you, by making only allowing B average kids participate will only make things more difficult,

more unreachable and less foreseeable by my fellow classmates. ",Rebuttal
but honestly we all do actually need it.,Rebuttal
The people that really likes to play sports is going to try everything they can so they can play sports. ,Rebuttal
"this then may mean that the sports teams may be bad because they spend all of their time on school, and trying to get better grades. Also no principle wants to have or represent a school that has a bad athletic ability and or team. ",Rebuttal
"If I had to have my grades at a B average I would also have troubles keeping it like that, and I would be very upset if i couldn't play sports,",Rebuttal
"but most students find it real difficult to keep up our grades, study for tests, and even do homework because we feel that we are being pushed passed our limit and we are too busy to continue to focus on academics.",Rebuttal
" But this goal might be too high for some students,",Rebuttal
but strongly disagree with it at the same time. ,Rebuttal
"That is what school is all about, pretty much if you do your homework every night, listen to instructions, and come to school every day, i guarantee you student athletes wouldn't have to worry about a thing.",Rebuttal
"But, some kids can't do that well and depend more on after-school activities to get a good career. ",Rebuttal
I think this idea of B average to be in sports could really be beneficiary ,Rebuttal
This is a positive about changing the policy but i still disagree with changing it.,Rebuttal
but that's alright because at least the people who deserve to play are getting too.,Rebuttal
If you were to ask any kid about the policy even ones who don't play sports they would say wrong.,Rebuttal
"But it is also important for the kids to be able to enjoy what they want, and this should be segregated from extra-curricular activities.
",Rebuttal
"But i don't think that that is a very great idea because, a lot of kids wouldn't make the team or they wouldn't get to play as much because their grades were not as high as they were suppose to be. ",Rebuttal
but don't push them or kids like me becasas all its going to do is make things worse. ,Rebuttal
This is agreement that will show students what school is all about. ,Rebuttal
"but we are just humans everyone nearly is going to make a C or even fail something once in their life if not more and taking away a privilege for a passing C, I think is not right to do at all.",Rebuttal
us children think differently. ,Rebuttal
"With this exception I believe they should take two days a week from the practice schedule or club to be further assisted with this problem.

However, this is the only exception I would recommend. School comes first and students should learn this now rather than later down the road. ",Rebuttal
but the ones who are should have every right to join in on the most fun they might ever have in a lift time,Rebuttal
"this plan to change the policy would not help nor support me/ us because many students have a grade c average.
",Rebuttal
" i think that if a student is on a team it will encourage them to bring up there grades academically and also students want to go to games and other fun things so i think that they wont just be going to school and doing things that bore them.
",Rebuttal
" If you just think about it, there's really no point to join a sport with a C average ",Rebuttal
" I can assure u that will not happen.
",Rebuttal
They will still have to pay for the people that are still on the team for uniforms and sport balls to play with.,Rebuttal
Well they are wrong. To participate in sports is a privilege that should not be abused. Some of the best player took education more important than shooting a ball.,Rebuttal
But if they're trying their hardest and a C is the best they can do then continue to let them play sports.,Rebuttal
"but we are in the present right now, and what we want to do now is play sports.",Rebuttal
there are some students who just are not able to maintain a B average. ,Rebuttal
but at the same time they are working hard to meet the goal to bring all their grades up to a B average. ,Rebuttal
But even if this happened in my opinion parents would agree with this too ,Rebuttal
"but every student is different, and some may be content to simply graduate as an average student from this school and move on to the next level in their athletics career, and you shouldn't take advantage of your power by changing their eligibility to play on an athletics team.",Rebuttal
but is not fair for all the students because some students are smarter than others because not everyone is smart. ,Rebuttal
but I can almost guarantee that the majority of them wouldn't.,Rebuttal
"but in the end if they work hard enough, they will be able to participate.
",Rebuttal
" I don't agree with this statement because the students who work hard for their grades should deserve a reward and for those who don't, it wont be a consequence but more of a way to motivate those students into doing something better for themselves. ",Rebuttal
" but is it absolutely necessary for the future? I say no, ",Rebuttal
Driveless cars have various accomadations that can't be obtained by humans. Their sensors allow a better response and control than a human driver when using breaks,Rebuttal

It seems this would be even better statistics without crashing than most actual drivers today. This technology could be designed to be alert and tentative, reacting to every mishap, something that even some actual drivers today have trouble with due to distractions. ",Rebuttal
"But, being bored and keeping people safe rather than having fun at the wheel and puting other people in danger is the better way to go. this could also stop people who get disoriented at the wheel as well.",Rebuttal
"While there are many benefits to fully automated cars, there are also risks that come with the technology.",Rebuttal
Break throughs with cars will allow people to save lives and put safety fisrt.,Rebuttal
" Although that is a concern the cars arent going to always be self driving, that can be changed with the push of a button or the flip of a switch. the driver can choose when he or she wants to drive and when they want the car to drive its self.",Rebuttal
"but many manufacturers believe that whith in the next few years those laws will be changed, but if those are changed then new laws are going to have to be put in place. Those laws can help a company because the laws would either state that it was the drivers fault if they got hurt in the self driving car or if it was the manufacturers fault for making said car. ",Rebuttal
 But automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that problems ahead will be solved,Rebuttal
but they are not better. They will destroy humainity.,Rebuttal
however I do not believe that driverless cars are the future. I believe that they are dangerous and could do more harm then good,Rebuttal
"Imagine driving a driverless car and it shuts down in the middle of traffic ,there is a person driving behind does not notice you are having car troubles and hits you. Whose fault is this accident ? Whose going to pay for the damage? ",Rebuttal
"But, there are consequences that comes with that project. ",Rebuttal
But i do like that this car has speed sensors at the wheels antilock brakes. ,Rebuttal
"but that's just being paranoid about the bad possibilities rather than wanting to explore all of the good that can from this. Like the article argues,
",Rebuttal
Technology is something that makes life easier. But the con is that you cant always depend on technology to work 24/7. ,Rebuttal
"The con for this is the actual cost. How much will this technology cost to develop? The economy is always changing paces and it isnt always possible for everyone to own the lastest and greatest technology. Im also very sure that the maintenance and repair cost of something like this would be through the roof just like any other technological advancement.
",Rebuttal
but they can also be dangerous in ways that people not might even think about. ,Rebuttal
I do like how Gm has developed the driver's seat to vibrate when the car is in danger of backing into an object because of my personal experience with backing my first car into a fire hydrent.,Rebuttal
"Which seems great but the quote, ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"", is a huge issue.",Rebuttal
The Self driving cars that are currantly in use right now still give the driver controle over the vehicle. The cars even need some human help.,Rebuttal
but they are really accidents waiting to happen.,Rebuttal
 but there is also danger ahead of us ,Rebuttal
"Although these situations can be more strenuous, driverless cars, like most newer cars, have other ablilities such as anti-lock brakes and other sensors, which help detect problems with the way the driver is moving the car, and help prevent driver-related catastrophies (5)",Rebuttal
but all good things must have a few boundries.,Rebuttal
 But just because I think the invention is cool doesn't mean it is effective in our everyday lives. ,Rebuttal
"but it could only be a matter of time until mistakes start to arise.
",Rebuttal
but I'd fall asleep and wouldn't wake up when the car needed me. ,Rebuttal
but one would have to wonder the cost of a car like that. Probably something none of us could afford to buy ,Rebuttal
"although when you come to a stop, although it has sensros on the car, does it sense the other driverless car? What if that car in the other line isnt't driverless and the driver decided to wave you along and let you go first, what would the car do? Does it truly function probably at an intersection? ",Rebuttal
" the cost of the cars to begin with is going to be outrageous. Somepeople and companies are not going to be able to afford the cars. The cars savings on gas will never compare to the crazy cost of them to begin with.
",Rebuttal
"hacking is commonly a misunderstood phenonenon. The aboslute requirement for all hacking is access to the device that someone wishes to hack usually through some internet connection on the device linked to other functions. This is easily remedied through the use of local software on the driverless car, cutting it off from the internet as well as making the entertainment and information systems independent of the driving system.",Rebuttal
"Getting back to the first issue about laziness, people are still sitting down whether in a driverless car or a conventional car and that these cars will likely be extremely expensive with all the added sensors for the foreseeable future, encouraging walking as an alternative to money as well as creating a walking trend so that when these technologies are cheaper, laziness would not become a problem.",Rebuttal
there is always room for improvement and this generation has plenty of time to improve on that situation.,Rebuttal
"the cars would have to be more and more carfully programed and very well tested, to ensure they don't cause harm to the driver and its self.",Rebuttal
Therefore i believe self driving cars are getting a bad rep without even getting a chance. ,Rebuttal
but they also can harm you. ,Rebuttal
but what about the ones that don't pay a whole lot of attention to the road while they're driving? ,Rebuttal
"but then the human in the car has to take over because the driverless car cant go around everything. Such as a road blocks. It can give directions to get around them but cant do it by themselfs.
",Rebuttal
but i think it would cause more problems. ,Rebuttal
"But,instead why don't they do they same cars now days people used and do it as the driveless cars it would be the same only thing that would be differnt is that everybody would have one it would be much easier and it wouldn't be public they would have to ride with other peopl or go all squish together because it's full. ",Rebuttal
This will not deter the developers though and many people are still working on them today.,Rebuttal
but how will it really,Rebuttal
To help with this they put in a vibrating chair to vtell the driver that they should take over. Itis said in the text that some states will welcome these cars once proven safe. ,Rebuttal
"Well, with the technology going at the rate it is today, it wont be a problem in the future. Also, in paragraph 7 it says, ""The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" This shows, that the car can drive by itself, but to keep everyone safe, it uses precautions, and had the driver help out with making simple duties. ""It is a safety feature, and safety is a big concern.""",Rebuttal
A variety of car companies have and are developing safety devices to assure the safety of everyone. GM has developed drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Automakers and manufacturers are assuring your safety while deveopling the future. ,Rebuttal
NO! You still have to know how to function the car and watch out for other cars. ,Rebuttal
"but with a driverless car, you would still have to learn the ways of road. You would still need to be paying attention on the road ",Rebuttal
With technology advancing at rates that it is why are driverless cars so bad to some people when a computer is capable of knowing everything and people seem to be getting less and less smart every day why are driverless cars not an option. ,Rebuttal
 but there will be far more accidents then when people regularly drive.,Rebuttal
there should also be limitations ,Rebuttal
" However, some of these problems are easy to prevent now. ",Rebuttal
 What happens when one or two of the sensors corrupt and the car steers off into the other lane? ,Rebuttal
"oh well they can still do that, but people who cannot drive at all really deserve to be able to get out of the house and be able to get what they need. Especially, the drunk driving that happens pretty much every day here in America, we need a safer way to be on the streets and I think this is it. Too many people are being killed by drunk drivers and if they just didn't have to drive to get home, if only something could just take them home instead, therefore everyone would be safer, driverless cars could make America so much safer in that aspect.",Rebuttal
There are some other great featurs that the car will have such as the traffic jam feature that will have heads up displays around he car telling you when your going to have to take over the car and drive it your self . The car also watches you and he road so that the car always knows if your ready to take the wheel or not. ,Rebuttal
"With the combination of the human's skills and the car's advanced programming, the car will become more safe and more effiecient than ever.",Rebuttal
but then the work would be done. ,Rebuttal
"However, driverless cars are now able to notify the driver when he or she needs to take over the controls in trecherous situations",Rebuttal
"With this being said, I think the rate of car accidents will decrease because there will not be any distractions for the driver in the car, and it will be quicker for the driver to be notified if something were to go array. ",Rebuttal
" But, lets be real most people now and days don't really look at the road ",Rebuttal
but in reality they could cause many horrible effects ,Rebuttal
but having a car driver by itself could be harmful.,Rebuttal
" That is where they are wrong, ",Rebuttal
 but the reality is a computer is no replacement for a human brain. ,Rebuttal
"But proportionally, using half the fuel we do now would have a much stronger positive impact on our future than careers being lost for the miniscule fraction of people who work as a taxi driver. ",Rebuttal
but it has some flaws,Rebuttal
"However, if cars were self-automated, automobile travel would be much safer",Rebuttal
"These people are right, but it is not a reason to deter the development of these machines",Rebuttal
But why would there be an accident if there would still be a driver in charge of that as well . A human brain with technology would be a perfect combination making it safe for everyone.,Rebuttal
"but it's evident that since the past there have been innovations made to cars and our everyday lives that has only led to greater things through out the decades.
",Rebuttal
"Despite these challenges, driverless cars are still the best option for transportation in this nation. ",Rebuttal
"but, what if the senors failed? What if every single sensor failed and someone was incapable of controlling the car? Who is responsible? ",Rebuttal
automated systems should and would not replace human drivers but instead suplement them as in the case with commercial aircraft.,Rebuttal
"I beileve they dont realize that testing and researching these new methods is a step foward, for safety, and not for just the sake of testing variables on somethings. ",Rebuttal
"but that comes with anything there is that is new. There are most likely a couple years before these cars will be ready to sell, so that leaves a lot of time to fix all the problems and flaws. ",Rebuttal
 But reported as today there have been no accidents involving these cars. ,Rebuttal
With new tech comes a lot of software and coding one wrong thing could lead to injury and even death. This is why people would rather not have a self driving car out on the road. ,Rebuttal
"However, that doesn't mean that totally autonomous cars will be successful. ",Rebuttal
" I disagree with them because it's safer if we have a real driver in the car, they'll prevent anything bad happened.
",Rebuttal
"The thing i disagree with is the car driving by itself because if that does evolve to regular society, then I think we will have something else to deal with. ",Rebuttal
However cars like this should not be made until they show that it can operate properly under any circumstance and any weather.     ,Rebuttal
but anything could happen once you get behind the wheel and actually drive it and test it out. I don't think anyone would want a car that could steer for them that's more dangerous then having antilocks. ,Rebuttal
but there isn't a 100% assurance on the capibility on hacking into the system.,Rebuttal
but the negative impact outweights the prositive impact. ,Rebuttal
" but how can you trust a drunk man to properly operate a driverless car? You can't. Anywhere that there seems to be a pro for these cars, there's a con not far behind. ",Rebuttal
 If it comes to that point to where you would rather take your chances with the driverless car that is up to you. ,Rebuttal
"But by doing this the driver would be very distracted by the displays and if the driver needed to ""take over"", they would be too distracted to do so in a life saving manner. ",Rebuttal
"That's actually not all you would need to do. Not only do you need to make sure everything is working properly, you would need to make sure what ever is functioning the car is functioning correctly at all times. One of the biggest concerns could be a driver might not know what could be wrong with a car and if something is wrong with the system, he wouldnt know and the car would just break down or stop working. ",Rebuttal
but that would be an amazing thing to have.,Rebuttal
not driverless cars that change nothing except the driver.,Rebuttal
 It could also be a negative based off of how it is a invasion of privacy. ,Rebuttal
But in the future these cars could make things alot better for the world. ,Rebuttal
" but in the long run, that would cause a lot of unemployment. If people no longer have to drive themselves, that would mean that police men would not need to arrest people from the road.",Rebuttal
The good thing about them is that there would be less accidents due to people on their phones while driving. ,Rebuttal
"I am for the development of driverless cars. I believe driverless cars would improve our world.
",Rebuttal
"There could be different types of driverless cars, like a certain type for the highway and one for in a city. These questions are not yet answered in certainty but will be soon. ",Rebuttal
Yes that could make it much more safe but the only problem is there is alway criminals in this world who kill.,Rebuttal
However driverless cars can be a major advancement in technology if the technology produces good results and can be consistent.,Rebuttal
 The driveless cars will use sensors.,Rebuttal
This wouldn't be a good car for a first year driver but maybe for someone that has plenty of experience with driving.   ,Rebuttal
But is driving honestly that much work?,Rebuttal
think of all the accidents it would prevent.,Rebuttal
"While the person in the driver's seat may not be ready to take the wheel. The driverless cars that have been made already alert you, giving a reminder that you still need to remain alert. ",Rebuttal
but even that is preventable.,Rebuttal
"Take into consideration that while there would still be problems, there would be far fewer than before. Don't make laws prohibiting driverless cars! ",Rebuttal
" Some manufaturers hope to still make it fun by providing entertainment systems. While they can be truned of instantly if manual driving is needed, it would still be safer than having people today who text with cell phones while they drive. ",Rebuttal
"The cars are still in progress, meaning there is still a chance for a new upgrade in the system itself. The manufactures can create a system that will stop the car automatically if there is any type of problem with the car or technology. ",Rebuttal
but they would have a great impact on our nation. ,Rebuttal
and it is not that at all. ,Rebuttal
Some designers have thought to use a vibration in the seat to alert the driver. ,Rebuttal
To me it seems like the manufacturer should be blames since they designed the car with the technology that failed. ,Rebuttal
that could be prevented with annual mantainance,Rebuttal
" I refute this statement just as the article did it's self by saying ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved"".",Rebuttal
"That's why all of these cars go to certain measures to keep the driver attentive of the road incase human assistance is needed. Infact, the cars may eventually have displays that will render cellphones useless because the cars themselves can be used to text, call, etc., thus making them safer than a normal car.",Rebuttal
but death or injury is massive price to pay for laziness.,Rebuttal
"When states see that the car is just as safe, if not safer than a manual car, the laws will most likely change to accomidate a driverless car. If not, there will be many studies to evaluate the saftey of the car and statistics will show that there are less collisions in the driverless car, so the states that still haven't passed the law will most likely pass it at this point.
",Rebuttal
"However, if the driverless car was completely developed then there wouldnt be a need for the driver ",Rebuttal
"but if you look at paragraph seven, it mentions that although these cars do not need human assistance, the driverless cars can not detect crashes or road construction like humans can.",Rebuttal
they are too unreliable. Keep driving a thing that humans can somewhat control.,Rebuttal
"Of course not, is the answer.",Rebuttal
"this puts too much trust in the computers. While tested, and proven safe, it is still worrysome to think about the fact that the operator's life is solely in the driving skill of the computer that is driving the car. It is unrealistic to put this much trust into a computer preforming a predominantly human activity. ",Rebuttal
"But, you still have to pay attention to the road. The car isn't completely accident-free. What if the dad who has all of his kids and his partner in the passenger seat starts drifting off at the wheel? It's dark and he doesn't have to focus on anything so what's keeping him awake? What if he doesn't wake up when his car alerts him that it is about to crash and the car gets totalled? Although seemingly incredible, driverless cars offer up far more cons than pros. ",Rebuttal
" but through trial and error we can fix those problems and perfect the car.
",Rebuttal
" however, manufacturers are not at that point of high level saftey and can never guarentee one hundred percent safety. ",Rebuttal
but the lack of safety tips the scales towards the negative side. ,Rebuttal
yet manufactures say that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe.,Rebuttal
"But we all know you need batteries for those things and they wouldn't last forever. So all this does is prove another point, and that is that the driver of this car needs to be alert the whole time while in this vehicle. The one thing that we all know is that people aren't going tto pay that much attention to the road, they are just going to be facinated by the car. So this just shows that this will just cause more danger to themselves and the people around them. ",Rebuttal
But who says the car can get them there without loosing gas or electricity. Then they don't know where they are and theycould hitch hike but they won't know where to go. So now they have to take risk and dangers with these cars.,Rebuttal
"While it is true that competely driverless cars aren't available yet, companies such as Google and Tesla are continually developing driverless cars to handle more and more driving situations, and the only time that a driver is required to take over control of the wheel is in complex situations such as maneuvering through roadwork or a car accident.",Rebuttal
"This can be true, but everyday technology advances, and humans become more and more accustomed to it. ",Rebuttal
"But, some manufactures hope to bring in some car enterainment and information systems so that the driver would be entertained in having something to do when they´re not driving. ",Rebuttal
"What convinces me these are not the right direction for us to be headed in is the fact that they will be run by computers. Trust me, I do not hate computers by any means, I actually have a passion for them, but the idea of having my life in a computers hands scares me",Rebuttal
you may now text without your life being at stake as it says in the last sentence of paragraph eight. ,Rebuttal
"Manufacters not only want the people to be safe but want their product to sell as well as the story quotes in paragraph 8, last line. Why sell something messed up to the people to have them get seriously injuried and then no one buy it because of its bad reviews? Therefore, I believe manufacters would test and secure its driveless car product for safety before putting it out there on the market.",Rebuttal
"but, the car is just now getting started. In the future you can expect the creators to make the car more successful. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. They grow closer to achieveing their goal of an amazing car everyday. Wether the car comes in 2020 or 2075, it will provide a greater future for us.",Rebuttal
" Driving, wether it be in a driverless car or not, should not be a ""fun and exciting experience"". Do people realize that they are in a machine that holds the capability of taking the lives of many? That should not be something fun for you, you should take it with a great deal of seriousness. Scientist, that study the brain, say texting while driving turns off one of the parts of the brain that is used for focusing while driving. What do people think all of the in-car entertainment will affect your brain when it becomes that 10 percent of the time that you must take control and drive",Rebuttal
"Technology is clearly not ready if automakers are just hoping that problems ahead will be solved. This mindset will get people killed once they decide to release the car to the public.
",Rebuttal
". But there are certain restrictions that need to be solved first.
",Rebuttal
"Considering these things though, if they were to teach the kids or even adult that didn't grow up around these cars the rules of the road and how the car works to prevent accidents like this from happening then i'd be all for driverless cars.",Rebuttal
But there are some downsides that come in to affect when concerding getting one,Rebuttal
"Whn really what would happen is that they would have to pay more attention to everything around them, which would cause even more work. The cars would need to supervised more than they do now, because they would be moving and need us to take on more responsibility in controling the car. This could end up not working, because the cars could end up going out of our control. Which could cause more problems for us.",Rebuttal
in a postive way these are allowed to be tested in most states and upgraded to the point of the driver can receive alters to notify them on things. ,Rebuttal
"This is not true,",Rebuttal
but this is in fact false.,Rebuttal
"Although if they are a passenger in a car are they bored?

As Dr. Werner Huber added ""We have to interpert the driving fun in a new way.""",Rebuttal
The maunfactures think this can be safer do to the progress in the heads up display system which some cars may have and this can allow people to send a text message and keep their eyes on the road watching for when they may need to take over in driving. ,Rebuttal
but if the elements were out of your control would you feel safe with your life in the hands of a car?,Rebuttal
but soon they will be new laws added.,Rebuttal
"However, the idea of a driverless car is still in the making.
",Rebuttal
"however, there are now many driverless vehicles that can transport a passenger without any problems",Rebuttal
"Monitoring these vehicles as they drives where ever is a smart thing because they can see how and why these errors happen, to be fixed. ",Rebuttal
"I would on the other hand have to remain always focused incase of an emergency or an accident though, and that is why i do not think it is the best idea in the world. ",Rebuttal
Actually driveless cars still and will always require human assitance. ,Rebuttal
" Although there are few flaws to the designs of driverless cars, these flaws should be fixed very soon. The article states, ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day."" This quote shows that many of these issues should be resolved in the very near future.
",Rebuttal
Too bad it would cost billions and billions to replace every single road. ,Rebuttal
What would happen if an accident were to accure or if there was major traffic? Would cars be able to menuver around? What about state laws?,Rebuttal
"""It's complicated..."". I believe the government should be involved in building this form of public transportation. The way I invision us paying for this is and expansion on estate tax. the estate tax is a tax on a persons inheritance over 10 million dollars and in America this is set at around 40%. This means someone who inherited 10 million and one dollars would pay a tax of 40¢. If we expand on this tax and other taxes similar to this we could no only fund our expansion on public infrastructure but also pay for other extraordinary things such as tuition free college education.",Rebuttal
but it has already happened.,Rebuttal
"However, there are some concerns about safety in driverless cars. ",Rebuttal
 In the previously stated mishaps the current versions of the cars will promptly alert the driver that there may be an upcoming event in which they will have to intervene. ,Rebuttal
"That is not the case it is almost driverless but not fully, because you still have to keep your eyes on the road and listen for the signals the car gives you.",Rebuttal
"Yes, that is most likely true but they will create so many more jobs. The amount of jobs created will be more than the ones lost. As Spock once said ""The needs of the many outway the needs of the few, or the one.""",Rebuttal
"Yes, people might get lazier but it is better than people dying form crashing their car. ",Rebuttal
but if every one drove a deisel car or truck that will be just as fuel efficent becuase a deisel burns hotter so it burns off alot more of those harmful chemicals. and a deisel creats more power.,Rebuttal
"The traumatic thing about that is, there can be glitches and the car can freeze. The car could glitch, or, freeze in the middle of the road and create a terirble accident that could lead to death. ther are too many negative outcomes towards the car , that, changing the world that much right now, or, even in the near future is too much to try, and handle.",Rebuttal
but I feel as if it would be a lot safer with a human ,Rebuttal
but those could be prevented by making laws for these cars before they're made for the public. ,Rebuttal
" But I don't think that this makes the cars driverless I look at it more as assisting. Also the process will be very expensive, for a simple radar it costed two hundred million dollars! ",Rebuttal
"If the driveless car developers wait for another 10 to 20 years on having them on the road, it would be better and much safer because the more time they spend working on them the better it will be and the less problems and damage there will be. ",Rebuttal
"But what they do not know is the developers have allready looked into that problem. The answer is a digital display windsheild, you can watch a movie on your window. You can call or text from your car as it is driving. So when it is your turn to drive the display would turn off and it would tell you that you have to take over. ",Rebuttal
"It's just that their are really to many distractions in this world for anyone, not everyone, to stay completely focused.",Rebuttal
"but it's just not worth it. They would cause many more accidents on the road. Yes they would save money, but having non regular cars would save lifes. ",Rebuttal
but it could be very benefitial for a parent. ,Rebuttal
"I am not against us becoming a more advanced civilization, but I just think that the cars are worthless and not a good idea, and here is why.
",Rebuttal
"i dont think so if it makes the roads safer then noting should be to much of a hassel.
",Rebuttal
But is it really a success for everyone? There's no problem with today system of people driving on their own so why change it. ,Rebuttal
There's always new laws and how would the computer know the new ones? What if the computer gets the laws mixed up? A computer can stop working and you might not even know it! If a person mixes up the laws they can get a ticket or even get sent to court for not knowing them. It could keep the roads safer. The car messes up and what would happen? The car gets taken away? It goes to get fixed? ,Rebuttal
but it can help reduce them. ,Rebuttal
"The trouble is, replacing ordinary roads with these smart roads would be ""simply too expensive to be practical,"" the narrator states in paragraph three. ",Rebuttal
" but just because you are able to do what ever while the computer takes you to the place you are going, doesn't mean you can.",Rebuttal
"but it still won't protect us from computer driven cars. This is because computers are electronic, meaning they can be tampered with, hacked, and even shut down while in the middle of something. Also they can malfunction and take you to the wrong place or even drive you off a cliff or into water.",Rebuttal
 the car is still not completely safe.,Rebuttal
however it can be done. ,Rebuttal
"That being said, the driverless cars that we have now are already smart enough to do their own thing but yet warning us when it comes down to needing human attention. ",Rebuttal
"As we all know, though, technology isn't perfect. Which is exactly why the ""Driverless Cars"" are a terrible idea for our society.",Rebuttal
"There are tons of problems with the other side of this argument. One of the problems is that they see car using less fuel than today's taxis. When in reality they are using abolute the same in coal usage. Other claim that they have stated is that the car is driverless. How can it be driverless if it still needs help through harsh traffic and consruction sites. They also claim that it saves money, but in the end the car will cost a forturne.
",Rebuttal
but I personally think there are more disadvantages than advantages.,Rebuttal
however it could also fail resulting in the faitality of another human ,Rebuttal
These advance cars are surely safe.,Rebuttal
 but really it is not ,Rebuttal
"However, since real people are driving the cars they can evaluate the situation and control the car. ",Rebuttal
"Think about the future though. If we have only driverless cars in the future no one would even have the slightest idea on how to drive. I am sure they would at least get the basics of driving but what if one day the computers just fail and the internet is no longer of use? People who are on the road when this could occure may die. With with this kind of problem, their would be far more fatalities than a couple of wreckless drivers on the road. ",Rebuttal
"but, its not always about having fun; safety comes first.",Rebuttal
"do not fear. Automated cars will not be devoid of human interaction. According to paragraph seven of ""Driverless Cars are Coming"", ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are deesigned to notify the river when the road ahead requires human skills."" ",Rebuttal
There are others who have seen the negative side of having these cars around. ,Rebuttal
The truth is that that is not completly correct.,Rebuttal
"however taking this concept while maintaining human control could prove to be more benenficial, due to the lack of issues such as liability and also keeping humans active and engaged. The problem is that most people would nate place full trust in technology, thus eliminating the purpose of a ""driverless car"" being completely driverless. Ultimately, this potential asset is far outweighed by the costs of producing driverless cars. ",Rebuttal
"The problem I see is that if another driverless car starts on its own and drives away without you, where does it go? Another problem would be that if another driverless car comes into your way and you both crash into each other who do you blame the person driving the car because they were not in control or the manufacturers for not programming the car correctly to avoid collisions like this? What would happen if we did get into an accident? Would we be likely to live or more likely to die because we couldn't control the vehicle?",Rebuttal
"but driverless cars might be too reliable. Although this is all well and good, there are challenges and hurdles driverless cars will have in the community, safety will still be a concern to some people. ",Rebuttal
"but if we were to make a car that did all the driving we would get bored and probably fall asleep driving. Which in the long run will cause accidents, as I said before accidents would be hard to decide who caused them.",Rebuttal
but if everything turns out bad your company is going straight down the drain. ,Rebuttal
but the chances of this coming out as a positive invention is beyond me. Its dangerous enough on the roads with cars but by making cars driverless is beyond dangerous it will cause so many distractions and so many deaths. ,Rebuttal
I think the positives stand out more then the negatives because they really do help.,Rebuttal
we humans are not big on change.,Rebuttal
"Although driverless cars are good with brakes, thay can't be relied on enough to put ones life in their hands. ",Rebuttal
"This can also be a problem however, as many companies claiming to have made these cars are wanting to release them before this time, showing that this prediction doesn't matter to them. They could care less if the car is actually driverless, they just want money.",Rebuttal
"But, with the more advanced technology, they can show the states that the driverless car is perfectly safe. They would also help with decreasing the amount of accidents the United States has dramatically.",Rebuttal
but what if a deer jumped in front of the car and the car is going 60 mph the car isnt just going to stop your going to wreck. If they really wanna make these cars they need to have good protection like a tank or sometin because that would be safe.,Rebuttal
"Little do they know, driverless cars have a lot of sensors, such as a soecial touch sensor that makes sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Driverless cars are not completely driverless, it will require human skills when needed, as said in paragraph 7. Driverless cars do not put people in danger.",Rebuttal
"they also have a large amount of cons that many people don't ever think about because they are blinded by the fact that these cars can basically get you where you need to go with little to no assistance from you, the manually driver. ",Rebuttal
"what if these cars have a malfunction or technical diffuclitys? That could also be very harming to the public and you. If these driverless cars has a malfunction it could also put your life in danger along with the other people around you.
",Rebuttal
if you don't trust it you will have control of your car still you don't even have to let it do its own thing. People can sill control it and do whatever you want like it was the same car.,Rebuttal
"There are negatives to owning a driverless car such as you, a driver or passanger, may not be safe. Technology can always have a fault, what if one of these cars drove you into the other lane causing you to hit a car or you run off into a ditch. What happens when to cars hit eachother, who is at fault. The driver is at fault of course, the drivers need to be in control of the cars ",Rebuttal
"but I don't agree at all. I feel like you have to put in just as much work as you do now to dirve the ""driveless"" car. You shoudn't have to keep your eyes are the road at all times because its suppose to do what it is suppose to do when its happening. ",Rebuttal
"i disagree becuase if people are doing what the are suppose to be doing you can get in a wreck so easily. I think that we should be able to control it whenever it is needed. If people dont want to us the ""driverless"" car they should be able to have an opition to turn it off and on.       ",Rebuttal
"Some manufacturers hope to keep drivers entertained and awake by, ""binging in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off when the driver is needed."" (p8) ",Rebuttal
The reasons why these cars have not been made yet isn't because we don't know how to make them or even manufacture them. ,Rebuttal
but the road construction op front is way to expensive for us to do for the cars to be as safe as possible.,Rebuttal
" Although this all sounds very exciting and futuristic, driverless cars are still not driverless. ",Rebuttal
 there have been lots of accidents in the past and it would be harder for driverless cars to be able to dodge them or take a different route if its a recent accident.,Rebuttal
But are we going to risk several other problems to look cool? ,Rebuttal
but they could also fail at any time and turn into a bad situation. ,Rebuttal
but not everything can be sure to always work. Anything can fail at anytime. ,Rebuttal
a human driver seems more truthworthy than a computer that may or may not short circut at any moment ,Rebuttal
"Thats why i also support the driverless cars to let the driver take control at certain points while driving. Eventhough the driver would have to still keep watch of the rode, thats what he or she have to do anyway.",Rebuttal
but then what is the point?,Rebuttal
"This is simply just not the case. Autonomous cars have been proven to get in very few accidents. They are equipped with sensors all over, giving them vision far beyond human eyesight. If all cars became autonomous, they would be able to communicate with one another on the road, removing dangers due to lack of communication we currently see in human drivers. ",Rebuttal
But what would happen when the car needed them to take over.,Rebuttal
"but technology isnt always reliable. there can be malfucntions. What if a driver is in the middle of traffic and the car is having technical difficultkies so the car just spins out of cointrol and cant be handled.

Thats also affecting the drivers around them. ",Rebuttal
"Well: who assembled the robots, who programmed them? Humans did, thus introducing human error into the problem. ",Rebuttal
"However, driverless cars, as stated in the article, ""are designed to to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill."" Thus, in an emergancy situation, the driver can take over the car can advance past the situation and continue to move along without any issue.
",Rebuttal
"In a hypothetical world where the autonomous car drives perfectly in all conditions, the driver would still be able to take control of the car and drive as s/he pleases and continue the drive as they wish it to be driven.",Rebuttal
" but a better way to observe the idea of a driverless car is to think of it as a car, just like any other, with a few extra features; and one of those features happens to be that the car is capable of driving itself. ",Rebuttal
but this is still not a reason to stop the development of new technology.,Rebuttal
"The only problem is, that there are to many difficulties that come with these new products and they will never be in the peoples good interest if they are not solved. ",Rebuttal
but it does more work so that the driver does not have to. This was partially the goal of driverless cars.,Rebuttal
"But the compaines are praising this as if nothing is going to go wrong. The stats do show barley any crashes occur, but the one problem is were not talking about mutiple people having one by just one car in a certain area. ",Rebuttal
"While that may seem amazing, the dangers of having cars drive themselves overtakes that because driverless cars are not completely driverless, traffic laws may change, and we need smarter roads.",Rebuttal
But I just dont think its a good idea right now. mostly do to the fact that most of the accidents now are because of drivers not paying attention to the road while they're driving. The whole driverless car thing is only going to increase that lack of attention that drivers are paying to the road. All because the drivers will feel that they arent needed to do anything while theyre driving.,Rebuttal
but the car can alert you at anytime telling you that there is a problem with the system or something.,Rebuttal
"However, many, many people enjoy driving, simply for the feel and the experience.",Rebuttal
"Driverless cars would have all of these sensors that will keep the car from crashing or breaking speed limits. These driveless cars are only mimicing a human at the wheel, but these signals and sensors are way safer then a humans senses and signals.
",Rebuttal
" but even people have missed seeing a Deer, Racoon, and in some cases even people. Also how is a car going to know the difference between a person daydreaming and one that is alert? What if the car notifies you too late that they dont know what they are doing? Will you be left with all the blame?",Rebuttal
"it gives control to technology and computers, in turn giving way to technology errors. Many people dont want their families getting hurt do to a technology error when they could of had control and been fine. ",Rebuttal
 But where is the proof that it is safer? ,Rebuttal
"Some people who don't fully trust the concept, like me, need some control.",Rebuttal
" Once they prove that the cars are more ""reliably safe"" the other states will join in testing driverless cars. ",Rebuttal
but there are many things that can go wrong with this idea. ,Rebuttal
 no this will not again this will make the whole lazy and careless,Rebuttal
"The inventors of the car are making it safe with all the sensors and warning signals needed, but sometimes that is not enough, accidents still could occur.",Rebuttal
"But people should be fine with having to take the wheel sometimes. The text states, ""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents"" (Paragraph 2). and it also says, ""...none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" (Paragraph 7). So they are correct when they say they are not truly driverless. But for now that is the technology we have we should accept it, and who would not want to feel as if they were in control during situations such as a wreck, or a work zone. And it we all ended up having driverless cares we would not have to worry about us having to take over the car through a wreck zone because these cars do not wreck. ",Rebuttal
but thats the only positive thing I see out of this.,Rebuttal
"This is not true.

Infact, if drivers were to dissappear due to the appearance of driverless cars, there would be even more problems than today.
",Rebuttal
"They are wrong because humans can manage to stay alert while the driverless car is still driving. The car can manage to ""steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" ",Rebuttal
"however, I believe that if these autonomous cars come about, the need for gas will be less and jobs will be lost. Without people needing a whole lot of gas, what's the point in multiple gas stations around town? ",Rebuttal
the cons are just to great. ,Rebuttal
 I believe that they should continue to be improved and developed. ,Rebuttal
"driverless cars will not help whatsoever. People will continue to be distracted by their phones and other electronics and think that since they are not controlling the car, they do not have to watch the road. This is a mistake. If people stop watching the road altogether, more wrecks will occur. Mistakes will always be made. The number of crashes may go down slightly, but the feeling of unsafeness will only increase for the people inside the car.",Rebuttal
" Although times like these may come in handy it is still not a good idea to have them around.
",Rebuttal
 but they do not know what to do in all situations. ,Rebuttal
"But again, anything could happen and cause a lot of people to get hurt. I would rather know I am fully incontrol of something, than not know. ",Rebuttal
I do not think that should be on there.,Rebuttal
"But it may also put them in danger without them knowing. Another example, if you are a handicap, legally blind, or deaf, you may be in grave danger. The car again is on autopilot and is driving through a neighborhood and there are signs everywhere to when and where to stop, if there is construction, or there are people crossing the streets. You come to a stop at a stop sign, you are not paying attention, you are oblivious to your surroundings when doing other things. The car will go head but there is a car coming from the other side of the street where there is no stop sign. You and the other person collide. ",Rebuttal
"but the car may have a flaw. This again will bring conflict and debate. This can lead people to believe that driverless cars are unsafe and unproductive and is a liabilty. But say you were paying attention to your surroundings, instictively, you would look left and right. The car will go foward but, there is a car coming from the other side (remember there is no stop sign for the other car to stop at) you and that person collide. Again, the car is to have warned you but if you were alert, you would have taken control of the car when driving through a neighborhood. ",Rebuttal
Driverless cars are more for assisting rather than they are for driving. The person in the car still needs to remain alert in cases where they might need to take over. This shows that the car does not have complete control. ,Rebuttal
"wrong you still have to pay attention and be there for when roads are getting worked on so you can navigate your way through it. the even tell us in the passage ""they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out if driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating theough roadwork or accidents"" there not all as great as what people make them out to be. ",Rebuttal
whereas in reality there will be about the same amount. ,Rebuttal
"However, these cars would make more negative headlines than positive headlines. In the end, the negatives outweigh the benefits. ",Rebuttal
i think it's still highly dangours.,Rebuttal
but that could be easily depicted i'm sure. ,Rebuttal
they are safer than a machine in complete control.,Rebuttal
"Yes, the fantasy of having a completely driverless car seems like a good idea for drivers, and teen drivers such as myself, but this could result in people revolting against the safe regulations required when you're required to follow when behind that wheel.",Rebuttal
"but think about how much gas is already waisted in our world? lots plus,",Rebuttal
you can look at it has assisting. For example when your at a stoplight and your not paying attention to when its your turn. The driverless car has already got you covered. another exaple is when your trynna park and you're worried about hitting another car or pulling up on the curb the sensors on the car is a great help.,Rebuttal
 but I don't think it is a good idea to have driverless cars it may be safe to other but it is not safe to me because I wouldn't want to have a wreck driving in a driverless car.,Rebuttal
"However, manufacturers are developing an answer to this concern which introduces more safety than a regular driving environment would have. Some manufacturers are introducing in-car displays which turn off instantly when driver assistance is required, which is not possible with a regular cellphone or messaging device. This eliminates any in-car distraction during the driving task, With human error eliminated, driverless cars are much safer than regular ones.",Rebuttal
"yes, i believe the cars in the future will be able to do everything listed above, and more. If somebody is injured by a smart car i believe it should be the manufactures fault, but only if the person driving the car is actually using the smart car feature. If the person driving the car isn't using the feature then the driver should be held responsible",Rebuttal
 but I don't believe it is quite as safe as it seems. ,Rebuttal
even though sensors are nothing new they help stop the car like when the person driving the car hits the brake the brake sensors each wheel to ruduce speed so the human can gain controll over his or her car again.,Rebuttal
For this in-car entertainment the feature would only be avalible for the driver when the car is in traffic jam assist mode and would instantly shut off when the driver needs to take over the car.,Rebuttal
The driverless cars are not as safe as they seem with all its technology.,Rebuttal
but people would regret it later on in the years when more and more people get killed because of them,Rebuttal
"However, manufacturers have created a solution. According to the article, ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" This will eliminate the argument of getting bored by provide entertainment to a driver. Also, as technology advances, this can shut down when the driver needs to take over again so no accidents occure",Rebuttal
 But by using electricity it will likely increase payments in electricity which wont be good for people when paying their bills.,Rebuttal
the negative aspect to this would be that the cars still arent truly driverless.,Rebuttal
"but even with a non driverless car it could still be free from crashes. You cant blame crashes on the car it is the driver, so the driverless car really isnt that different from a careful driver because either way there are still wreckless drivers that could crash into you. ",Rebuttal
"As i pointed out in the last example, this car claims to protect from danger but they cant say that for everyone.",Rebuttal
" but in realitly it wont help you improve your driving skills, by buying this car you will depend mainly on this car but still have to drive it because it is not 100% driverless. ",Rebuttal
" Driverless cars have motion sensors and other things that make it safe in that range.
",Rebuttal
"The driverless car that Google had tested is just a single individual that was properly observed and was better taken care of. For the half million miles it had driven, consider the half million people that might drive these cars compared to one test. From one to half a million is half a million more risks that Google had invented. Even the company knows that a car is not a car without the driver. The driverless car still needs a driver so that the car an alert the driver when needed. Now what if the driver was not alerted fast enough or not alerted at all do to a malnfuntion? There are many flaws about the ""future cars"" that manufacturers can not control. ",Rebuttal
There will never not be faults in some sort of new brand from phones to airplanes there will always be a fault somewhere so to completely throw this idea out is absurd and uncalled for.,Rebuttal
somtimes it is others who cause the accident,Rebuttal
"Eventually these cars will be able to navigate through all situations without any human support. This will allow passengers to enjoy the ride and drive longer distances faster. As well as maintaining confidence in thier safety.
",Rebuttal
"Driverless cars could be the future, but there would still need to be a lot of work done to the cars to make sure they are completely safe for drivers.",Rebuttal
We must remember the safety aspect of it all. Is it safe? We must remember the cost. Is it affordable? Some of these questions will really make you think. ,Rebuttal
that does not mean that those can be fixed either.,Rebuttal
" but will they have enough time to completely survey the area and assess the situation? Or will the car be able to warn them in time? The answer is most likely to be answered, but is still a dangerous situation for a new driver. ",Rebuttal
"But it all comes back down to cost. The thought of replacing all roads with ""Smart Roads"" is not only seemingly impossible, but timewise it would take a lifetime. If every single road was taken apart and rebuilt all over America, the world even, it would take at least 10 years, and the cost would be enormous. And these cars are safe, but if that situation ever hits, no one is going to want their death or disability caused by a car driving on its own because of human error, yet again. ",Rebuttal
"All in all, the technology of driverless cars could make driving safer than it is today. ",Rebuttal
 but over all as a coutry I think we could lose money. ,Rebuttal
"Though this article told us that the cars can go more than half a million miles without a crash, what happens in extreme conditions?
",Rebuttal
"but there is stress relief for not having to drive and not worrying about the road. Also you would be able to do whatever you want while the car is driving to your destination.
",Rebuttal
"However, every machine has a meltdown or malfunction so why would the driverless cars be any different.",Rebuttal
"Despite these amazing pros it would still require alot of work and cash to achieve this.
",Rebuttal
"however, with the self-driving driverless cars that is not something to be worried about.",Rebuttal
but its not safe.,Rebuttal
" However, technology is yet to prove that it can last forever without malfunctioning. This may cause accidents that could have been prevented. ",Rebuttal
but would it really be if Google makes it so that you would still need to be very alert ,Rebuttal
"If done correctly, however, driverless cars can revolutionize the way that many things today work. ",Rebuttal
"they are not full-proof. As with all technology, malfunctions would likely occur and cause accidents. Also, the driver may have a tendency to check their phone and do other distrating things if they rely too much on the technology, which would cause even more accidents. This again brings up the question of liability. Was it the driver's fault for not being alert or the manufacturer's for failing to alert them?",Rebuttal
" it is still good to allow the driver to take over when they want to or need to. WIth the addition to alerts and warnings telling the driver if the car needs to be manually controlled, it allows for a even safer enviroment.",Rebuttal
"but, in fact, these cars are safer than any other we have seen before. ",Rebuttal
"Although, there not safe, and there expensive. Before the creators put the driveless vehicles on sale on the car sale businesses, like Nissan, or Ford, they should add more safety features, and make it more cheaper so most people with a driver lincense can have one. ",Rebuttal
"Certainly this is just a minor problem compared to the actual driving part, and is planned to be figured out in the near future. ",Rebuttal
"how reliable would those cameras be, they could easily go out, break, or mess with other signals. ",Rebuttal
There are many things wrong with many of the statements above. ,Rebuttal
"How ever, the entire time there is a driver in control at ALL TIMES. There is not a moment where the car alone is moving. ",Rebuttal
I get all that but do we really want that is it worth it. i mean we mes up were human thats what happens.,Rebuttal
but then there are people in this world that are mean. ,Rebuttal
there will still be reasons why we shouldn't. ,Rebuttal
they will most likely change their mind when they realize how catastrophic driverless cars really are.,Rebuttal
but alot of people that drive them selfs havent had a crash either it just depends on who is drivening the car and if they are a reckless driver. ,Rebuttal
"but is it worth it? Think of the thousands of taxi drivers and limo drivers that would be out of work. Think of the people that work at the BMWs, they would be out of jobs and wouldn't be able to provide for the families they have. Is it all worth the unemployment line filling us in busy towns because the cabs have no reason to be driven?",Rebuttal
The simple answer to this is whoever is controlling the vehicle is at fault.,Rebuttal
"Another simple answer; install a camera that shows the driver and the driver only. This way, people could find out who was actually in control and caused the crash thus removing the flaw of the driverless car. ",Rebuttal
"Driverless cars are not fully driverless. Although these cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves there is still a driver. As it said in the artical, "" all are desinged to noify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" This would be like if there was a work zone at this point the car would alert the driver and he/she would have to take over. in the artical it states that the comepanis that arer making these cars have added a way of notifing the driver. Some of the formes of alerting the pasenger is by, vibrating seets, announcing that he or she should be prepered, and flash lights on the window shield. They have even thought of using cameras to make sure the driver is paying attention. ",Rebuttal
"However, the sensor technology existing today is already enough to create mostly self driving cars that require only minimal effort on the part of the drivers. Technology will only advance with time and soon, the technology to completely and safely automate transportaion will be made available. In the meantime, cars using technology such as BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" already contribute to making the roads safer and less monotonous. ",Rebuttal
"However, with the creation of new laws and technology, any situation will be able to be easily diffused and resolved. ",Rebuttal
"but i would have to disagree . Its true that safety is a big concern , but having driverless cars couldnt guarantee a decrease in safety issues and i know that human driven cars arent decreasing accident rates but with human driven cars you would know for sure how the accident happened .",Rebuttal
" Testing will ensure driver's safety which is the biggest concern. The upkeep on a car should rely on the driver. For example,if someone gets in an accident because their tail light was out,the fault is placed on the driver. The same concept should be applied in the maintence of this technology. ",Rebuttal
"Even though the self driving car does still need a driver, that doesn't mean the driver actually has to manually brake or accelerate. The car does this on its own without human support. ",Rebuttal
Why wouldn't you want a driverless car you may ask.,Rebuttal
but again what if the sensor quits working.,Rebuttal
but with good ideas there are things that can go wrong that people have to think about. A driverless car is a serious thing to think about before they get soild to the public,Rebuttal
"Although doing these things would be nice it is not possible with driverless cars. Driverless cars still require the ""driver"" to stay alert incase something happens. ",Rebuttal
 but we have to consider that we would constantly have taxi like fees. We would not be able to drive in the future if we have these cars. ,Rebuttal
"People will still want a car that they can still control at anygiven moment.

Drivers might get bored but at least they know they are save.

The driver doesn't have to stare at the rode avery second.

They can do other things while the driverless car is driving itself.

If the driverless car needs the person to drive it will notifly the driver. ",Rebuttal
I assure the buyer no worries. ,Rebuttal
"All those flaws might give the wrong impression about driveless cars, but we can find a soulution to all these constraints. They might not be 100% driveless yet, but we are getting there.",Rebuttal
"but there are also many issues I see with the cars developed. Having to have a driver in them ready to take over if nessesary, some states not allowing driverless car test, not having the exact technology needed to make these cars a safe as possible, and not to mention human error that can always occur in driving.",Rebuttal
" I think car manufacturers can test their cars in a factory in some states that it is legal to do it in, and once they prove that it is safe I believe that some states will uplift the laws that they have on self driving cars. ",Rebuttal
"This is one of the main concerns of people today, but I would believe it would be the manufacturers fault since they were the ones who made the car, and designed all the parts of it. Humans should have no worry about liability for themselves because the car manufacturers should cover all the expenses that happened in the accident since they were the ones who designed the cars. ",Rebuttal
" However, when a woman gets into a taxi and imputs her destination, she is entrusting her life in technology. ",Rebuttal
"there are still possibilities for mishaps and crashes. Because of this, section nine says that in most states it is illegal to even test computer driven cars.",Rebuttal
"but the car is still worth getting considering that it can drive by itself 90% of the time.
",Rebuttal
and to that i would say thats why we need to keep on developing driverless cars becuase there will be trial and error but there always is for anything new that tries to be made. ,Rebuttal
but they are already not paying attention. ,Rebuttal
"Although this is an issue that many psychologists are considering, some manufacturers are working to eliminate this issue.",Rebuttal
"But, is driving suppose to be fun? Or a way to get to one place or another. If driving was fun it wouldn't be safe. People would be drag racing throughout the city causing chaos and getting into serious damage. ",Rebuttal
but think of this what will happen if your car sensors and autopilot doesn't work anymore the passangers will have to drive but what if they don't know how to drive because the driving classes got taken away because these cars don't need a driver.,Rebuttal
"This idea does sound nice but as all other technology such as computers and phones, technology is not always reliable. ",Rebuttal
it is a change that can change the future of driving on roads for the better. ,Rebuttal
I don't think this because you still have to stay alert when something is coming up ,Rebuttal
" but in reality, it's not.
",Rebuttal
Driverless cars can casue a big chaos for some states many arguements will break loose.,Rebuttal
but then what is the point of having a human behind the wheel. People who are for the development of these types of cars do not get the whole idea behind the problem with these cars.,Rebuttal
"Some manufacturers like GM they have developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. Other car that tells the driver when they should take over the car is the Google car. Cameras in cars can help a lot because while the driver is watching the road the car is watching the driver. Some manufacturers are considering bringing entertainment for these cars and information system that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off when the driver needs to take over. This new tegnology in cars is really good, but how much these will cost? No one knows yet.",Rebuttal
"They should create driverless cars becuase some people have accidents and can result in death. So,to avoid that we need those driverless cars,we need something that can be useful for people who are seniors and when they are drunk or are just learning to drive. Also,we do need it for the people who take road trips or the people who have business trips and just have to drive for hours. ",Rebuttal
but it doesn't sound as safe as having a human behind the wheel.,Rebuttal
"but nothing is created without flaws. What would happen if the sensor stops working and the car isn't able to tell what is around it and rear ends somebody? Who would take the blame for the accident and who would pay for the damages?
",Rebuttal
but the developers have said that anything that exists today are still not entirely drivereless and cannot handle most things that apear in driving.,Rebuttal
"The discussion of whether or not the human in the seat or the car manufacturer will no doubt be on the minds of lawmakers, but they would quicky come to the conclusion that it would be the driver's fault, since the driver bought the car and knew what he/she was getting into. Manufacturers would also make a liability agreement required in order to driver the car. ",Rebuttal
Other than that the car seems worthless & is just another car problem that us Americans would have.,Rebuttal
"Although,

you can teach humans to be carful in a car, and yes we make mistakes, but humans, unlike computers, can adapt to complicated situations. ",Rebuttal
"This, at the same time though, makes candidates want to only go to the larger states to try to get their votes.  The smaller states once again feel left out and unappreciated. ",Rebuttal
That is incorrect because the electoral college pays close attention to every state to see which ones would be good to pick,Rebuttal
The Electoral College avoids run off elections unlike the popular vote system.,Rebuttal
"but it could cause voters to turn away on voting for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, and knwoing their vote will have no affect they will have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.    ",Rebuttal
So they do have a say in this partake. ,Rebuttal
This is why we have the voting we have today so each person can vote on who they want and still be treated the same.,Rebuttal
"there are manny thing wrong startign with popular votes can lose to electoral votes, also some states can get on people to come and campagne",Rebuttal
"but the winner-take-all system is still focusing on the ststes knowing that there going to vote for you, and notthe other states that possibly will or will not vote for you. ",Rebuttal
"But some people don't really know what they are voting for in election which is why the Electoral College is the way to go. Also people complained with the ""winners take all method"" some candidates don't go to certain states and only focus on the swing states. In the 2000 campaign seventeen out of fifty states didn't see the candidates. But the candidates didn't go to those states since they knew they had no chance of winning those states and they needed to focus on the swing states to make sure they win the election. Many people do call the Electoral College an anachronism, but it doesn't need to stick in the past, it needs to be kept in the present and in the future.",Rebuttal
but some will surely argue that they are not enough to outway the bad. ,Rebuttal
"Either way, no voter's vote is going to swing a national election and, with that information in mind, about half of the eligable voters in America voted in 2012's election. ",Rebuttal
"However, having a straightforward election where the votes come straight from citizens is most constitutional and much less problematic. The process has been used for a long time in our country, but it is time to make a change.
",Rebuttal
"Maine and Nebraska have an alternate setup of ""proportional representation"" as explained in article one. ",Rebuttal
"Elections are only a few of voters away from catastrophe. In elections there could be ties, deadlocks, in Hawaii they had voted the other way. Their are many campaigns about 17 states didn't see the candidates at all including South Carolina, a lot of voters didn't get to see campaign ads. Some win the popular votes but lose the presidency. About 60 percent of the people prefer a direct election from what we have now. ",Rebuttal
But really every one's vote does.,Rebuttal
"But it could lead to more pressure in the election process, which could greately complicate the presidential elections.",Rebuttal
"Even so, knowing their vote will have no effect, they will have kess incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would if the president were to be picked by popular vote.
",Rebuttal
"Is that fair?  All states should get the same amount of attention and infromation from the canidates because all of the votes are important and is the outcome ever really certain? How would we know the outcome of the election if the votes we put in all depend on a group of electors who could just pick whoever they like just because they can? How does that seem fair at all that the voters votes don't really matter and even if the canidate does get the most popular vote, the canidate still might not come out as the winner of the overall election?                       ",Rebuttal
"
but there are a few things that can be problematic like i don't know say bribery from the president to the electoral college,i mean come on it's not like that hasn't happened before,",Rebuttal
"but that was then and this is now. this is coming from the guy who faught for independence and peace...but had over 200 slaves himself,yeah not much of a hero.",Rebuttal
but it's less likely than a dispute over the populat vote.,Rebuttal
but the system of voting still stands because most people in America like this way of voting better. ,Rebuttal
While Plumer did put his point across as to how the system is unfair we must take into consideration how it is more reasonable and appropriate,Rebuttal
"To me, the voters who do like the electoral college pretty much just want to see that they can trust them just for the popular votes to succeed. But honestly, I think they still shouldn't be the ones to choose. Even if they may help the popular votes a little, they aren't fair in a lot of ways. Way more voters are against them than with. ",Rebuttal
Also the negatives of the electoral college are not really a big deal that coud cause a fixing or a inbalenced vote towards one side over another,Rebuttal
"However, this is actually not a good thing. 51.3% of people wanted Obama to be President. Not 61.7%. Yet Obama still got credit for 61.7%. About 10% of voters who didn't support Obama didn't get their opinion heard.
",Rebuttal
"It is not neccessarily a good thing when the last reason says ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elctions in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast"". Wouldn't that raise the risk of a tie? Though, it is extremely unlikely that a single vote may decide the president and voters in these elections want to express their opinion and prefernece. ",Rebuttal
"I disagree with them because the senators have a say in who is going to win the election and be president all at the end,so why worry. ",Rebuttal
"If a tie with the electoral votes is to ever take place, the House of Representatives would handle the election and state delegations would have the final vote for president. Also, if a tie does take place then the Senate would vote for the vice-president. ",Rebuttal
 The possitive things they mention about the Electoral Collage are small compared to the issues with it.,Rebuttal
"This is true but also could be a little dramatic. Ultimately, the citizens are the ones who are voting for the candidates not the electors. Without the vote from the citizens there would be no electors. The Electoral College process should still be kept even though there are some issues. ",Rebuttal
"but just because the possibility is low does not mean you can simply allow the flaws in the voting system to exist. A small hole in a fabric can only grow bigger, and the same goes for our electoral college. ",Rebuttal
 But I believe it is fair because the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between electon of the president by a vote of congress and election of the prsident by a popular vote of qualified citizens ,Rebuttal
it is an uruly and untrustworthy way of voting and should not be used anymore. Voters are easily confused when voting and many do not follow up on what is happening during election time. ,Rebuttal
"However, many of these reasons that the Electoral Collge should be abolished are just one time things, so consider the other side of the argument. ",Rebuttal
"That's right, but it's also unfair because states that have noone living there could all vote for one party, but it wouldn't help that much, unless the points were close and that state tipped the scale.",Rebuttal
Still we need to be able to make our own decisions.  We don't need other people to make them for us. ,Rebuttal
 however some history has shown us otherwise. ,Rebuttal
"But despite that the Electoral college is an accident waiting to happen, and just because no one has fought or protested agaist the Electoral College over the years its been alive doesn't necessarally mean its not going to happen in the future.",Rebuttal
"However, with all but two states being part of the ""winner-take-all"" system, ",Rebuttal
"Although this does help, it has only happened once, therefore proving to not be needed.",Rebuttal
but are also not that important. ,Rebuttal
I still do believe that this process is highly incompotent ,Rebuttal
"This is not true because in source one it says that when you are voting for a president, you are actually voting for who your electors are going to vote for. So if you vote say demcratic, thats a vote going toward the elector voting democratic in turn him or her voting democratic for the president.",Rebuttal
" that is not true. If the president was elected by popular vote he or she who is running can just go for the big states, win them over and all smaller states are left with no signifigant say in the election. ",Rebuttal
This statement is not true because the Electoral College forces the cadidates to branch out to get more votes. And if the runner knows he or she won't win that state why spend money and other reasources on a rewardless cause. ,Rebuttal
but with this change more people might start seeing that hey can make a change and start voting when it comes to it.,Rebuttal
 but chnging it to popular vote would be the best option,Rebuttal
but i think that is best . Everyne has their own opinion in matters like this but in this case i think whats best to change the electoral college . ,Rebuttal
"but if this is a democracy and the government is ran by the people, then the popular vote is by far better than the electoral college.
",Rebuttal
but change isn't always necessarily a bad thing. ,Rebuttal
but is unlikely to happen. ,Rebuttal
others may feel different and would like to keep it going due to it given the citizens a choice. ,Rebuttal
But if they can over rule your vote are you really voting for your president?,Rebuttal
"It is still possible to have a tie though because there are 538 total votes and since that is an even number then it can happen. And if there is just a stlight difference and instead the electoral college creates a landslide then that isn't representing the actuall number of the votes by the people. Once again you are being cheated out of your sya it the election. The hardest thing to understand is why people would still support something that doesn't support them. The electoral college basically throws away your votes and replaces them with theirs. And once again, it is possible for ties in the electoral college due to the even number of votes. ",Rebuttal
"In my opinion if there is a tie in the popularity votes then they should revote, it may take longer but it will still be a decision by the people. Just because it makes the procces faster doesnt mean it makes the procces better. They can create a better system in the event of a tie instead of electors over ruling the people and picking whoever they think is best. That isnt government for the people, by the people. ",Rebuttal
" All in all the major arguments agaisnt this process outweigh the pros of it, which are few. ",Rebuttal
 when really they are.,Rebuttal
The electoral vote crisis in two-thousand rarely happens. ,Rebuttal
"but with an Electoral College every state get two Senators and one House of Representatives. Which divide everything equally. Our votes are counted by our population of people. So, the Electoral College shouldn't be change. ",Rebuttal
 even if they have a tie the house of representative votes on the president not the people . ,Rebuttal
some say the electoral college fluctuated in the 2000 fiasco and had the biggest election crisis in the century .,Rebuttal
"This idea implies that all eligible citizens in the U.S.  to vote in the election when truth being over half of the nationwide population does not cast a vote, with the leading cause being apathy. Also it is implied that all citizens are informed about who they  vote for.",Rebuttal
All the college is trying to do is set a number of people who can be elected not elect the president on their own. ,Rebuttal
"but, in 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election, if that doesn't seem so bad lets take a look  at how many people are in the United States alone. In 1976 a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 from Hawaii had voted the other way. (Plumer, P. 12, line 80)",Rebuttal
but it normally does not happen ,Rebuttal
But that should be the reason one is elected. If they are most popular than why do they not get the vote. If they did the best campainge they should get the victory. ,Rebuttal
but there are also many concerns that can outnumber. ,Rebuttal
the reality of it is that the Electoral College is just trying to keep the election for President fair. ,Rebuttal
I understand that it is a law set by the men who created our country and it worked back then. It just isn't working in present day. ,Rebuttal
"I'm not going to lie and say that none of the people who do get to vote are all voting because they know their stuff about the candidates, but some of us who do know about the candidates and how they are working should not lose the right to vote for who ever we would like. If we dont get to vote for who we like and believe is better then what type of country are we.
",Rebuttal
This is true but if we are voting for electors that are going to vote for the president that we would like its  just like voting for the president there is not difference.,Rebuttal
"The statment means that basically each slate chooses some electors that go with the popular vote, and they are shipped off to go and submit the votes and the electoral votes, where the task they are given is rarely betrayed, or not done. ",Rebuttal
"although i am in favor of it, ",Rebuttal
if there is a tie then there should have the previouse presedent of the united states vote to brek the tie.,Rebuttal
"But, this point can be broken and can be unfair for the people. ",Rebuttal
however why should America risk the posibility of decite it has happened befor and if not prevented it will happen again.,Rebuttal
"however the electoral college is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state.",Rebuttal
Voter's in presidential elections are people who want to express a political reference and want the best for their country's future rather than people who think one vote may decide the election and disregard the point of voting.         ,Rebuttal
but nothing is perefect as we all know.,Rebuttal
"but as time goes on and technology changes, the world changes, and some things just are not the same and dont fit anymore. ",Rebuttal
"but

IT'S NOT FAIR",Rebuttal
"How does that give us a say though? For example, as it says in the article, Al Gore was the president that the majority of America voted for in 2000...he was the one that everyone wanted. Yet he lost the presidency because of this form of voting. This is a free country, or so we're told, so we need to be given the right of popular vote. ",Rebuttal
but their is a flaw with that even the most thoughtful people in the world make mistakes. Look at what happened with Nixon. The president is only one person. People make mistakes. Let the People make mistakes instead of forcing everything into a box like congress.,Rebuttal
allthought this is your still putting your vote towards a president. ,Rebuttal
I disagree.,Rebuttal
When people have to much freedom they don't know what to do and do wrong choices so i think choosing a elector is a good thing they have studied the president and have heard countless promises that he has done. I mean he or she most likley will vote for the candiate running for president you did because he or she is a elector he or she gets the people who also voted for the same person as he or she wants. ,Rebuttal
but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.,Rebuttal
I still think that the people will cofide more in popular vote showing them that they didn't just vote for no reason. ,Rebuttal
"Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president ",Rebuttal
"Yes this might be true but what about all the non swing states like for example Texas they could have been careful while voting but Florida was not, then you have Ohio and New Mexico who could have been careful to but compared to Florida their votes get lost even though they were more careful and thoughtout. ",Rebuttal
 but do people really know what this method is?,Rebuttal
but with this method its less likely,Rebuttal
" However, the Electoral College has already caused chaos between the two opposing sides. If we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more civilized because they now have a say in the government. If it doesn't work, then we can always change it back and no harm will be done. As you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to explore.
",Rebuttal
It's ok to go for what you believe in. You might get judged but who cares it's your opinion don't listen to them. ,Rebuttal
"but at least we got people as good presidents. You may not like them, but they have helped us over the years that we were in debt and need. Like right now the president's wife is helping the obese kids at school by putting in whole grains and healthier foods. Those are good reasons, but not as good as these. ",Rebuttal
"But at the end of the day, the people are nominating their president, they don't want others to do it for them.",Rebuttal
"However, we just want the electoral college vote to be abolished because the citizens would appreacite to have a chance in voting for a president by our opinion. I think that the popular vote is a better way to let us do this because it depends on the voters and who they chose for. This way, it will be equal for all of us.
",Rebuttal
"However, these are rare cases and when they presented themselves, the leadeers of the country were able to fix the issue in a way that appeased most.",Rebuttal
But the results over the past years have shown no party has an unfair advantage over the others. America has had both many democrats and republicans in office. ,Rebuttal
This may be true but voters do get to vote for thier electors and it is the voters job to vote for the one they believe will choose the right president.,Rebuttal
but at any time they can disregard the popular votes and vote for who they want. If that's the case then no one should vote since they basically only have an opinion on who should be elected. ,Rebuttal
"when in reality, they matter in every way possible.",Rebuttal
 but that isnt a big issue bigeest out of all the people in the USA the vote that they did made a person feel happy about themselves because it shows that some amount of people care.     ,Rebuttal
"but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" ",Rebuttal
When ever using popular vote to determine the president than the process for it isnt long; this system is unfair too because of the people choosing the president because of the words and lies it says ,Rebuttal
"but that usually means that those people need education and knowlege about the state of their country, and nned to be aware of how important their right to vote directly is.",Rebuttal
"but in reality, instead of avoid the states the candidates feel they wont get votes from, they should probably campaign there, and try to win some votes. ",Rebuttal
The popular vote just chooses which person is more well liked not who people think will make the country a better place and so far no one is doing so. ,Rebuttal
"It seems alright, until you realize how unfair it really is",Rebuttal
" But, the information given above disproves these unvalid arguements",Rebuttal
"it can also prove more effected for the fact that there will always be a winner no matter what. The popular votes system cant be represented by most states like the electoral college does but, it does have the vote of the entire country as opposed to a few states with more representatives. ",Rebuttal
"but nothing is perfect. Sure the Electoral College messed up twice, but that isn't some mass amount that was detrimental to our nation. ",Rebuttal
" Neglecting voters that are potential supporters of one's campaign is, in my opinion, the worst way to go about winning",Rebuttal
But there are definalty more cons to this procedure. The constitution states that we are here to create a more perfect union but how are we supposed to create a union when the government is basically in control of everything. There is no unity gouing on in our government it more like the government is in charge and we are kind of just here.,Rebuttal
"who also comes to contradict themselves originally with ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43% Percent plurality"". In that instance, that one vote could've made a HUGE difference on our future ",Rebuttal
" Key knowledge that must be analyzed is that: just because a service is organized, does NOT mean its correct.",Rebuttal
 it is something to figure out. ,Rebuttal
Less electors need to needed and more of the population vote needs to be added in to the final election. ,Rebuttal
"but what of the smaller states like Montana, or Maine, or Wyoming even? they deserve as much of a voice as the others.",Rebuttal
 but it sure beats the college. there are too many variables for the college. too many areas where something can go wrong.,Rebuttal
"If the people are barely being represented, and a state with less than a million voters has as much say as a state with 35 million voters, then it doesn't matter if the process gives a clear winner.",Rebuttal
"Tell me one benefit there is to having no vote as regular citizen. I get it that there are more people in some states than others, but that does not mean we all get the same number of electoral votes as the huge states such as, California, Florida, and Texas.",Rebuttal
"On the other hand, even though the electoral college evens the votes of the oublic, what if they choose the other candidate then the one that the public chose? It wouldnt be fair not only to the state but the other people who choose that candidate and the candidate him or herself. ",Rebuttal
 really its just more worth it.,Rebuttal
Defeat is guarenteed... don't people understand what that means ,Rebuttal
What is not fair is that everyone doesn't get to vote directly only the electors do. Many people don't agree with Posner and they shouldn't because the electoral college is the wrong way to run things. ,Rebuttal
"This is true, however,""that trust is rarely betrayed""(Does the Electoral College Work?).""",Rebuttal
but this too has rarely happened. We need to continue with the Electoral college process despite a couple rarely occuring cons because all of the reasons to retain this fair system heavily outways the negative. ,Rebuttal
Well true but why would they both of theses candidates are running for president they need to get as many votes they can if they are bad or good . Even though we are technically not being fair with theses states ,Rebuttal
but in the past the electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate. You do not want to put this in hands of someone who will not help you and the other people on such an important event like voting. ,Rebuttal
This still isn't fair because this is saying that the smaller states with less representatives do not have much say in the voting and this will turn off potential voters. ,Rebuttal
Then we have the disagreements and they are pretty good logical points.,Rebuttal
But if the Al Gore vs. Bush happen once what stop it for happening again the reason why it happen was because we had Electoral College so to stop it. We Must stop it. ,Rebuttal
"but? This is the country i live in, this is the country i was raised in, this is the country i love and am so blessed to be",Rebuttal
But this can all be due to the fact that the electoral system was made by our founding fathers on the Constitution so it may only be natural that they support it,Rebuttal
but it is actually very fair since there is more people in that state ,Rebuttal
" I disagree with this statement because the electoral college gives candiates a fair chance to win electons and the people get to pick who they want to represent their states.
",Rebuttal
All of these things are in fact true but what if you are willing to risk all of that just to be able to be the one who has a say in who becomes president.,Rebuttal
but there is zero evidence shown to support this ,Rebuttal
and it makes presidents focus on states disproportionally ,Rebuttal
"i say that if the outcome isnt fair then how are u supposse to win as a president. Having more votes as a canidate is not fair but thats how you win by having more votes.

My opinion on that is why would losing be fair thats the point one canidate wins and one loses. of couse the other person who lost would have anger and therefore be upset and say that the electoral is an unfair jugdement. ",Rebuttal
"However, if everyone believed that, no-one would vote at all.",Rebuttal
"Yes, that may be true, but again, when the people vote, they only want what they want, no jokes.
",Rebuttal
"Yes this may be true but, have you thought that they created the Electoral College to help citizens live better?",Rebuttal
"And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. ",Rebuttal
" it still needs to be used because to many thing can happen such as ties and run-offs that we would need to figure out in the long run.
",Rebuttal
" but its worth standing there or watching it on telivision to hear , to feel the excitement of there ideas to help the low class , to help every class not evan the low class , its everyone to help everyone in the own ways . ",Rebuttal
" If this were to happen then there would be the chance to have run-off elections, since there would be no clear winner if the votes were very close.  There would be the complete unbalance from state to state, Rhode Island would have little to no effect on the election, where as with the Electoral College it could be the state to choose the winner. ",Rebuttal
"but much better than the previous system, the despised electoral college.  Throughout the years we have seen twice where our course of history could have been radically changed, with a different president ",Rebuttal
but this happens rarely. ,Rebuttal
So there is only one way that the electoral colledge is helpful and it is not even to the American voters. This is why we need a change and to get rid of the electoral colledge. ,Rebuttal
"In the second article, one of the arguments as to why the Electoral College should be abolished is incorrect due to the fact that not every state has the ""winner-takes-all"" system.  Since they got imformation wrong, people can not count this article as a reliable source of information. ",Rebuttal
"Then why do you beleive an upside of the elecoral college is that those in more neutral states will feel their vote counts? Or do those in party-dominated states not matter, since those in neutrals think way more about their votes, and are the only ones you should trust, according to him? In practice, they are the only deciding factor",Rebuttal
"everything to do with what is wrong with this winner-take-all system, being the 2000 election.",Rebuttal
as if a tie between the millions of US citizens is.,Rebuttal
"can be easily solved by simply giving the presidency to the candidate who receives a plurality of votes, rather than a majority. ",Rebuttal
but it is not.,Rebuttal
But there are many reasons why it's not. ,Rebuttal
the Electoral College is more helpful and here is why,Rebuttal
 but if thats how the system is set up then it should not be changed because if it does change then maybe everything would be different.,Rebuttal
but i promise you we wont fool around and compirmise the whole system beliving in our own belifes,Rebuttal
but their defense isnt that strong sorry to tell you that it gives me five reasons but there not strong reasons and I belive source two out battles the both  source one and two. ,Rebuttal
but we all humans and if we make the wrong decition later we can't judge you because we elect our president our ''saver''. ,Rebuttal
This argument is opinionated and has no substantial evidence behind it. ,Rebuttal
" but some of the biggest states only vote on democratic or republican canidates and thats not fair at all.
",Rebuttal
The author absolutely makes no point because you still are basicly puting in a vote for the president but just not directly. The Electoral College  is the way America organizes the voting system. ,Rebuttal
"Although that is true and it is possible, it is also incredibly rare.",Rebuttal
but now it's in the wrong time period. ,Rebuttal
But the constitution has rights and amendments that doesnt allow for those types of incidents to occur. ,Rebuttal
"The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that needs to be overruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I personally think that is the best way to decide who gets in. ",Rebuttal
 some thimes you find better traditions ,Rebuttal
In my opinion the Electoral College works perfectly fine so their should be no reason to change the manner in which we elect our president and vice president. ,Rebuttal
"the fact that there is a chance that it could is overwhelming. Clearly, against even the smallest odds, the Electoral College can cause a catastrophe. ",Rebuttal
"While I understand this; however, there are flaws in this process that must not be over looked.",Rebuttal
the Electoral College has far less flaws than the vote by the general population. ,Rebuttal
Some things should change about the electoral colledge. But more things should stay the same. After all that the voting would be a new thing. ,Rebuttal
But it really  complicates the process of the presidental election ,Rebuttal
On the other hand some states like California and Texas's votes have no effect at that point. ,Rebuttal
"but they have people to do it for them. As long as they cast in the right vote for the party that that candidate represents, then the Electoral college board should be filled with all the right people.",Rebuttal
"but if the majority of the people are represnted, then that's all that matters. ",Rebuttal
" because the college is fair to the people -because they represent the people- and the college is a smart idea. The college works in everyone's favor. For those that disagree, there is always a strong chance that the candidate represented by the elctoral college will not win presidency. ",Rebuttal
This shows us that even the people that are fighting agaist the Electoral College are making random statements that either go for it or against it because they don't know what they are fighting to achieve. ,Rebuttal
"But, with the winner-take-all system we will have a certain outcome with no disputes. This gives the canidate a landslide electoral-vote victory in a state. ",Rebuttal
"But, each party selects a slate of electors who votes for the party's nominee. We the people get to choose our slate of electors, so you get to choose who gets to vote for the president of your choice, which is fair.",Rebuttal
there have only been two times that this has happened. ,Rebuttal
"but thats not how it works. Imagine the small states, no canidate is going to spend time in a state where they have no chance of winning making it unfair to voters. Theres is also the chance of many segregationists where they don't even take into consideration on who their voting for only basing it on race and or ethnicity. Electoral college is a ""Disaster Factor""(Source 2).Many thing can happen in the mist of this selection where the results can end up in a tie which would cause worries.",Rebuttal
but should 10% of the nation decide who runs your country?! ,Rebuttal
 it is very unlikely to occur.,Rebuttal
whereas we already use the popular vote today as a way of forecasting the oucome and seeing the people's real choice.,Rebuttal
but it is to the states that are being ignored. They want equality and a chance to be recognized by each of the rivals. It is clear to see that the candidates give no sign of importance to states that have slim chances of them voting for him/her. ,Rebuttal
"but they're were close ones in 1968 and 1976. There's no doubt that, if a tie happens in the Electoral College, everything would go down south. ",Rebuttal
" However, this is untrue in my opinion. The Electoral College has already created so much controversy and dissension, along with faults and problems. For the well-being of our country, it would be best to simply get rid of the Electoral College alltogether.",Rebuttal
"The president of the United States is the president for an entire country, not just a region of it. Voters from the non-swing states will still want to see the candidate to decide on who to vote for, even though they aren't voting for the actual candidate. ",Rebuttal
A presidential candidate makes many a promise during their race for Chief Executive and there is no way to be completely certain that these oaths will hold true. The same goes for the Electoral College. Citizens must have faith in the candidate as they would in the presidential election that they will put their country or state before personal wants and carry out their responsibilities honestly. The Electoral College process requires trust like any other form of election.,Rebuttal
It is true that electors can choose not to vote for the canidate they pledged to and that this has happened in the past however the electors rarely betray their party's nominee and a tie in the electoral vote is extreamly unelikely. ,Rebuttal
however many people fail to realize hat it is rare for an elector to betray his nominee. Electors rarely betray their canidate because they are chosen by the canidates party or the canidate themself. ,Rebuttal
"But the thing is, even though it might not be enough to win the election, it extremely benefits the candidates race.  Another defense states in Posner's article is that the trust of the slate of electors that you are actually voting for is ""rarely betrayed.""  This is a flawed defense because it shouldn't be rarely betrayed, instead, it shouldn't be betrayed at all! ",Rebuttal
but I beive the best way to select the president of the U.S would be by letting the people chosse what they think is the best so the people know they are noticed in this contry. ,Rebuttal
But thats were you would be wrong.,Rebuttal
"Well this can be argued by saying that this method may help the candidates because if they know that they have no chance in winning in some states, they might specifically prepare a certain speech that may persuade the state to vote for them. Also no voter's vote swings a national election. ",Rebuttal
"But the Electoral College avoids the problem of there being a run-off election. If there was no Electoral College, this would put pressure for run-off elections, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, which it invariably produces a clear winner. ",Rebuttal
but others are also against it. ,Rebuttal
"Just because some may choose not to vote for the person they are supposed to doesnt mean that the entire college is bad. These things are going to heppen with people who think differently. Just because someone may think McDonald's is nasty and they refuse to go; are you going to not go because they don't? This happens in everything we do we are only human, we are different, not everyone thinks in the same way. When we do it is a recipe for disaster. ",Rebuttal
but what about now,Rebuttal
"False, Electoral College vote for the president. I want to keep the Electoral College.",Rebuttal
"however, this would require all the states to change their policies, which we all know won't happen very easily. ",Rebuttal
Each person has their own point of view about each thing but mine is that we should stay with the Electoral College system because it benefits the people in Florida and the United States. ,Rebuttal
 Now I understan how this can upset some one but it doesn't mean we have to compleatly abolish the system. The hiccups in the system dont even happen every election which to me makes the problems irrelevent,Rebuttal
They are wrong to disagree with the Electoral College because the College keeps everything going in order and in a clear path to let us know who our president will be.,Rebuttal
"That makes some people diagree also, but the Electoral College doesn't count how many people in each big or small state voted for president. All the college does is help the governmtent elect for the president that they most support and elect for. ",Rebuttal
"Even the Founding Fathers believed in the vote from the people to elect their leader, but it has shifted away from it.
",Rebuttal
"but if enough citizens like myself write to their local, state, and federal congress members, change just might be possible.",Rebuttal
"These claims are not based on evidence of the system being correct or being fair, these calims are based on a fear of change.",Rebuttal
but we do need the college because we also vote there and if  we dont then we do other important stuff there.,Rebuttal
Eventhough though that is true and they do vote for a slate most of the time each party selects a slate of electors trust to vote for the parties nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed,Rebuttal
there is no better system for choosing our President. ,Rebuttal
I personally beg to differ. I feel that voting for presidents would be more organized if we counted each individual vote from each individual person.,Rebuttal
This is the thing that can not be changed because this is a system that we can pull up see what they were elected for and why they were voted president and how many times. It helps us how we can choose the right president or the right vice president.,Rebuttal
"On the other hand, there is the election by popular vote, gives everyone a say in whom they'd like to vote for. ",Rebuttal
"Even if the electors that are selected and its said that the trust is rarely betrayed, the electors can still betray the person they're voting for and it can happen and it has happened before. It also doesn't say anything about the electors avoiding states that they know won't vote for them and going to states that can swing the election. ",Rebuttal
What if their was a tied would citizens like a machine take thier decision on who's going to be the leader of the United States ? I don't think so becasue a machine doesn't have a right to vote. ,Rebuttal
This isnt true because if it were so outdated and unfair it would have been substituted or changed by another system but it has remained because of its effiecency. ,Rebuttal
Certainty of Outcome is a strong point for Richard a. Posner in his article defending the electoral college and carefully states ,Rebuttal
"Although the ""swing"" states system is used, it is simply utilized becauseit induces the candidates as seen in 2012's election. But the voters in toss-up states are most likely to pay more attention to the campaign, and it is decreed that the most thoughtful voters should be the chosen ones to decide the election. ",Rebuttal
there are also ones who could care less about who the President is and just want to keep America on the edge of her seat while they decide who they want to vote for. ,Rebuttal
"But how can you trust them with a decision held in their hands with willing citizens to think about. """,Rebuttal
"ut shine a little light on the situation, it should be in America's people hands and hearts who the president should be.""...  ",Rebuttal
"But in reverse think about the the biggest election crisis in 2000."" ",Rebuttal
it is just about as fair as popular votes.,Rebuttal
"but no one voter can decide an election, and that is because the voter doesn't vote for what president they want, but for what electors they want who in part will vote for the candidate. Though they have a valid arguement the Electoral College is still the right method for the job. ",Rebuttal
But that is not all of us.,Rebuttal
"but a successful president should be able to sway the whole country into voting for him, not just a certain region. Thus, showing that regional advantages prove meaningless with the Electoral College, making it less unfair to other regions. ",Rebuttal
" this doesn't preserve the equality for other smaller states's citizens that the United States stands for. This makes it apparent that without the Electoral College only the ""big states"" would matter and the candidates wouldn't have to worry about the small states. ",Rebuttal
"but it does more harm than good and it doesn't truly change anything. As a result, the Electoral College solves the issue of uncertainty and significance of vote. ",Rebuttal
"That situation had not happened since the election of 1888 . In the past 200 years , only twice has electoral votes changed the peoples mind  ",Rebuttal
"Having a campiagn ad shows people what you want to do, how you want to help, how you want to make a change, ect... I don't understand how unfair it can be to people. ",Rebuttal
but how are my fellow Americans expected to trust a group of people who have betrayed us before? ,Rebuttal
"but with time, things change, and just because we've used something for a long time, doesn't mean we shouldn't upgrade. ",Rebuttal
but I'm sure that we can find a better way to break the tie than having untrustworthy people decide the fate of our homeland. ,Rebuttal
but the american people the real voters want a voice. also the winner-take-all system is just like not fair.,Rebuttal
"People can see what the ones against the electoral college are upset about, its true, it is the electors who elect the president, not the citizens who vote. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominees, and that trust hardley ever betrayed. ",Rebuttal
But the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that the large states lose in population. ,Rebuttal
The only disater factor on the electoral college is that its not a modern sense.. When you vote for a presidental candidate your actually voting for a slate of electors. The Electoral College needs to be updated in the method of selecting a president. ,Rebuttal
"Still, the downsides of the Electoral College outweigh the benifits. ",Rebuttal
"it is a way where everyone could be involved in fair desicions. ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" ",Rebuttal
We do understand that they put a lot of work in trying to become president but not everyone can win.,Rebuttal
"[; however,] it i sentirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.
",Rebuttal
"however, old methods don't always stand the test of time. Election by popular vote makes more sense in today's world.  ",Rebuttal
"that candidate might win and the people of that state will not even know who is this winning candidate until they see him on tv as an actual prsident, which probably means that the winning candidate won't help that state because he does not know well enough about it. ",Rebuttal
" but i disagree. Richard Posner, writer for slate magizine writes that this method is non-democatic, and should be overruled(source 3, paragraph 15). Although you are not actuially voting for president, you are voting for who votes for president. ",Rebuttal
"by voting for a democrate elector, your state will vote for a democratic president, if your state votes in a republican elector, then your state will vote for a republican president. It is as simple as that. ",Rebuttal
"but, either way the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state anyways.",Rebuttal
it's still not fair to those who get confused and end up picking the wrong elector which leads to wrong vote towards the presidential election,Rebuttal
"but there are more states who do have the chance to chose and make a direct decision rather than picking an elector who may or may not go agaisnt the party that had picked them and then they can end up chosing who they, the electors want instead of what the voter really wanted and intended. Many people may be able to agree that it is best to abolish the Electoral College instead of keeping it. ",Rebuttal
"but provides no evidence to support the claim, invalidating it. ",Rebuttal
"but this entire argurment relies on the fact that there are not enough electors in any one region in order to elect a president. Although this is true it doesn't matter because the same is true of population, no one region has an overwhleming population advantage over others and population is what matters in popular vote. ",Rebuttal
"This is a parochial and shortsighted viewpoint, not considering the fact that the system of popular vote would make candidates pay attention to all populations, making all voters more educated rather than having some elite educated aristocracy in the swing states. ",Rebuttal
but the exact same thing would happen in popular vote because some states have larger populations and candidates need larger populations for election in popular vote. The electoral college in this instance changes nothing meaning that the argument leads nowhere.,Rebuttal
Although that is a disadvantage of popular vote I believe that the vast unfairness and averting disaster is worth the cost of slightly complex run-off elections. ,Rebuttal
"The only reason this is the case is because the canidates spend their whole time in the swing states and they completely alienate the other states. In fact, in 2000, seventeen states were completely skipped over by canidates ",Rebuttal
But this also is simply not the case. In 1960 the demorcratic electors were almost completely replaced by electors who would vote in oppostition of JFK. Sometimes electors flat out refuse to vote for the canidate they were elected to vote for. Cases like this completly undermine the very idea of the electoral college. ,Rebuttal
"but they would be wrong. In 1968 the outcome was only 41,971 votes away from being a tie. In 1976 it was 5,559 away in ohio and 3,687 away in Hawaii. With the Electoral college in use, a few swing voters could throw the whole election.
",Rebuttal
what a lot of people dont know when they vote they are also voteing for other electors. ,Rebuttal
But this should only be used in case of a tie in popular votes. ,Rebuttal
but not as much as the electoral college does. ,Rebuttal
They shouldnt be worried about this a tie could happen but is mostlikely never going to happen,Rebuttal
"but this isn't completely true , the winner take all method motivates candidates to focus their efforts on the "" toss-up "" states.",Rebuttal
but this country is ran by the people and their dicisons on how to move foward. ,Rebuttal
"The popular vote may not be entirely fair to all states, but it most definitely is better than the electoral college.",Rebuttal
it is still possible and causing unnecessary stress.,Rebuttal
But its actually a fair voting system.,Rebuttal
I think that in a way most people dont really have a party so their vote goes unjudged and they choose who they want in the office.,Rebuttal
"I strongly disagree with that quote because the voter no matter what is voting for there side. Weather they are voting for democrate, or republican the vote goes to an elector and then brought to state, which goes in as a vote for presidence.",Rebuttal
Now how is that qouted true when for years the Electorial College has worked everytime. ,Rebuttal
"He is simply stating that if there is a difficulty in the popular vote election, they have an electoral vote to choose the winner. ",Rebuttal
but it still has happened ,Rebuttal
"but then it goes further on to say ""it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" That statement proves that it is unfair and not right not just to the candidate but to the people who overall voted for them.",Rebuttal
"It also says in source 3 that ""no region (Soth Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" But it sure does play a big role in deciding whether or not the President you want to win, will win or not ",Rebuttal
"Also because of states being more popular than other states the Electoral College might as well say that those states are better than others, which is not true",Rebuttal
 but I belive that those people are just parnoid pessmist and need to learn to have more faith in the people that we elect or the president appoints.,Rebuttal
Just because some people choose not to take it seriously does not mean you should take the right away from everyone. ,Rebuttal
would cause more relief than it would tension ,Rebuttal
"But, it is not working today. The 2000 election serves as an example of a faulty system.",Rebuttal
"Seriously, that is absurd. Every voter should have the right to know they are going to decide the election ",Rebuttal
but that was the first time since 1888. ,Rebuttal
 I still think we should still change. ,Rebuttal
"In toss-up states however, voters tend to pay more attention to the campaign and really listen to the competing canidates. So in toss-up states, thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election but electoral college votes don't necessarily let that happen.",Rebuttal
 But in the event that the elector is chosen and does not vote for whom he or she was elected by the people to vote for. What happens then? The wrong president is chosen because there was a fault in the system. ,Rebuttal
but the other half is guys who have great degrees and are all smart wearing suites and decideing what the think is best. There not really thinking about the farmer and what all he does and his troubles.,Rebuttal
The reality is that their vote wouldn't potentially assist their candidate towards winning the election as much as your own standing vote.,Rebuttal
Our country prides it self on one thing freedom. Then we dont have the right to vote derectly on the peorson we want. So how in the world does that help us?,Rebuttal
"However, they can fix this problem by eliminating the electoral votes process",Rebuttal
"Usually the only problem would have to  be a tie in the electoral vote , in case the election would be thrown to the House of representatives were they vote on the president. ",Rebuttal
Even though it is unfair it is widely regarded it just tells whoever person got more votes ,Rebuttal
the likeliness of this happening with the Electoral College is very low compared to the likeliness of this happening in a Popular vote.,Rebuttal
"But this isnt always true because the candidates make sure to focus on the Toss-up states which  can define an election, and these are the people who really focus on the camppaign and unedrstand their resposibility to make the right choice as a state. ",Rebuttal
it doesn't actually add up to the number the citizens actually participate in.,Rebuttal
And others may have their opinions on this but it's ok to have your own opinion also different opinions don't hurt nobody it's just that different people believe in different things.    ,Rebuttal
new things aren't always the best things.,Rebuttal
But everyone should vote to express there politcal power. ,Rebuttal
it should still be dropped and allow the people to vote.,Rebuttal
 but now we have so much technology people can vote from anywhere they dont have to go put a paper in a box anymore. The system is outdated and unfair to many people.,Rebuttal
"Although this statement has some truth to it, it also has some false. The problem that i have with that statement is that there are no facts to back it up ",Rebuttal
"that was a long, long time ago",Rebuttal
" the Electoral College has its outcomes; Big States, Run-Offs and Presidential desputes.",Rebuttal
"However, you are still voting for the person you want. The people are still making a great contribution to the decision.",Rebuttal
"However, I think this is is not true. You are voting to get the electoral college votes for the president you think will do a better job guiding the country. Your vote truly does count.",Rebuttal
" And this is true, but isn't that how it should be?",Rebuttal
yes there might be an upsid eto having an electoral college but the risks out weigh the benefits. ,Rebuttal
" but in truth, the candidates are vistiting the swing states becuase they are thoughtful voters.",Rebuttal
"The answer is yes, but it's high unlikely, and very rare, if ever. ",Rebuttal
Compulsory voting would be far more effective if voter turnout is an issue. People who would not have voted otherwise would still likely vote for the candidate they supported if voting was made mandatory. ,Rebuttal
"Dissolving the electoral college would make swing states irrelevant to presidential elections, as it'd be impossible to win votes in those states by any decent margin. Instead, campaigns would focus on the areas in which they already have an agreeable population, as to encourage them to vote, and get the most voters possible, using their resources. Trying to win states, rather than population, allows for voters to be more informed. ",Rebuttal
"But that still doesn't mean that people shouldn't have their right to vote for who they think is best candidate. It should be the people's decision on who they want to vote for, not the electors. There would be no reason to vote if the people's vote don't really mean anything. ",Rebuttal
but the electoral college is simple and yet very reliable in many ways people dont see. ,Rebuttal
"The presidential canidates look for states that have the most electoral votes, but they also need more votes than the other canidate so every vote counts. ",Rebuttal
"Nevertheless, with a voting method as complicated as the Electoral College, the room for error is far too great.",Rebuttal
"Through this one argument, advocates are essentially assuming anyone who doesn't live in a swing state doesn't care about the election as much and therefore they shouldn't have a say in the matter. This is simply not true.",Rebuttal
"It's wrong because the big states are the ones that need that population in order for the candidate to win. It's pretty fair to do it by popuation because it depends on that specific person on which candidate is gonna win, not by the state. ",Rebuttal
yet the the electoral college still has defenders . This shows electoral colllege is good because it still has its defenders. ,Rebuttal
"Only we know us the citizens thats our right and now the are taking that right away from us little by little. Let me tell you why the Electoral College is dreadful, when we vote for which candidate we want to become our president it goes to a certain group of eletors and they use all the votes from our state to push up the candidate they want to become our presidant ",Rebuttal
"That's life though , life is unfair to everyone",Rebuttal
but it's for the best.,Rebuttal
but they are missing the point.,Rebuttal
"My answer would be no, because everybody is living in the country that wants a vote from everyone so why only accept the votes that are thoughtful.",Rebuttal
but that doesnt mean that in alls it is ,Rebuttal
"This causes lots of pressure which would greaatly complicate the presidential election process. With Electoral Collage, this produces a clear winner. ",Rebuttal
"But times have changed and people want to be involved now more then ever so when you give them a paper and tell them to pick who they want as their leader, they want their opinion to matter and to make a difference which i know that in some aspect, it does influence the outcome to a certain degree, but the electors votes still have the power to overthrow the rest of the united states citizens no matter how large the percentage of the popular vote is. ",Rebuttal
"It is still very practical and less complicated. The people instead would vote for slates of electors but, they still would be voting towards you canidate. ",Rebuttal
"This is not true because the number of electorals each state gets is always decided by the number of members that state has in the House of Representatives, plus two for the senators (Office of the Federal Register)",Rebuttal
"Also, The Electoral College considers swing states and big states ",Rebuttal
"This is not true because of the idea of swing states and big states.  Swing States, also known as toss-up states, are the states that pretty much decide the election. They could go either way (Posner).",Rebuttal
Though it may benefit in some way it still has its flaws and shouldn't be used in something as big as an election for the president of the United States.             ,Rebuttal
"Yet they are mistaken because clearly our popular vote can override this system if necessary. Though it is very rare most will argue, the fact that it is possible to not allow the Electoral College to take control of our government proves that the power is really all in the hands of the citizens. Clearly, the ''unfair'' picture most perceive is largely mistaken",Rebuttal
However I do not think it makes much of a difference who is being trusted to do what one likes about them.,Rebuttal
That is suggnifucnt because it shows that the peoples vote do matter. ,Rebuttal
"This, however, is quite far from the truth. According to source three, ""the residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised.""",Rebuttal
Yes there was a crisis but to say that the electoral college is corupt and bad just cause of that fiasco is to far. ,Rebuttal
"Well tough

, the Electoral College ensures a winner, and that is all that matters. ",Rebuttal
"it is a disaster factor, it is unfair against voters ",Rebuttal
" I understand what Richard is saying and he has lots of evidence to back his oppinion up, but i disagree with him. ",Rebuttal
but at the end of the day if that was the way it has been done for several years and there is no reason to change it now ,Rebuttal
"But in source 3 it states, "" But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"". This state the although the vote doesn't go directly to the presidents vote, it is most common for the trusted slate of electors vote for the president. ",Rebuttal
"First, why would a state turn its back on the majority vote of who their state wants to be president? If a state should do this, their representative would not be representing their state, therfore they maybe punished of may hear about it from the public.",Rebuttal
"But seeing as segregation isn't as big of an issue in the U.S, this isn't as prone to happen. ",Rebuttal
"There are also many flaws with this process though, and thats why I think it should be settled by popular vote. ",Rebuttal
"Even a equal representation or the ""equal voting system"" would create clear distinction having asian won. ""Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors""-source 1.",Rebuttal
but that still doesn't matter.,Rebuttal
it still allows the peoples' voices to be heard and expessed.,Rebuttal
"But of course, no single vote can change the outcome of a presidential election since voters in presidential elections are mpstly people who want to express an opinion than thinking that a single vote will change a election. ",Rebuttal
it has helped more than do any damage to any other type of voting like that tabs we once used to vote for everything. ,Rebuttal
" but that is very inaccurate. In a popular voting scenario, things are about as basic as possible.",Rebuttal
however it could as well be thought of as fraud of the system. These members of the College could potentially curve the results of an election. ,Rebuttal
"However, this sort of thing should never occur. There should never be an occasion of a problem occuring in something as substantial as a presidential election.
",Rebuttal
"However, this still does not change the fact that other states are not receiving the proper amount of campaigning to prove a fair election. ",Rebuttal
"Of course everyone has a valid opinion, but they would be wrong. The Electoral College is the easy way to decide who will lead the country, not the best way. Today's technology can ensure a more fair way to decide the fate of the nation ",Rebuttal
but not everyone really gets a say ,Rebuttal
but that is still very rare. ,Rebuttal
But in the Electoral College if there was a tie it would lead into a whole new process with the House of Representatives ,Rebuttal
But the good thing is trust because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed ,Rebuttal
Yet that has happened very rarely. ,Rebuttal
but not entirely.,Rebuttal
but it is entirely possible.,Rebuttal
I beleive this is a more efficent way to get votes from citizens. In conclusioun over 60 percent prefer a direct election to the kind we have no ,Rebuttal
"Don't you think we know that? Then there's the fact that only ""Big States"" have a say, what about the smaller ones? There are people there too you know. ",Rebuttal
but that doesn't help the fact that we should all have a say. ,Rebuttal
"With that I want to include that, if a state were to have it's own vote within the state and turn that into a vote then use that as a majority rule everything would be much easier.",Rebuttal
"But being realisic, no voters one vote swings a natioal electon, and about one half of the eligable American population did vote in 2012's election. ",Rebuttal
"All of these reasons are great and everything but there is always going to be a flaw in the system. Some believe that is is the people who vote in the presidents, however, all we are doing is electing the slate of electors who are are the real people who elect the president. ",Rebuttal
"but if we change the way that the votes work, the candidate that focuses on many smaller states can stand a chance in the election. ",Rebuttal
"its just when you vote you vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president of thier choice. ",Rebuttal
Now this is not a problem caused by the Electoral College but by people being misinformed whether by ads or through misinterpretation. The nominee that a person wants can still be voted for through a majority vote just through the states representative.,Rebuttal
A fear that has never been seen before in our country. There have been a few elctions where the difference was down to only 3-5 thousand but theses are still not ties. ,Rebuttal
The larger states still have more votes than small one just not numbers based in the thousands or millions. ,Rebuttal
But that is why you learn about your electors and who they want so you choose the one whon is going for you which is your president. Its as easy as doing a little research to find out who your really electing for as president of the U.S. ,Rebuttal
"I dont think that matters because why would they vote for someone who isnt fit to be president? If they are even up there, they are fit. So I think the Electoral College is just fine of a process to use for the United States of America.",Rebuttal
"Everyone should read some sourses before making an disision like this. Not just the people voting so that even the people not voting will fully understand why one disision is being made and whyone isnt being made. This one thing can affect the way electing president will be from now on to the future, unless they deside they want to change it again. ",Rebuttal
popular votes will give you a more accurate percentage of votes each candidate recieves. ,Rebuttal
but i dont think it matters because in the end it would be chosen by the people that wanted that president not what the senators wanted.    ,Rebuttal
But should we really leave such a large and important decision up to such few people? A mere 538? And even less for toss-up states? ,Rebuttal
 but to be honets isn't better to have people like our electors to pick for us some one who really know about politics and about all of it. We all would be in better hands. ,Rebuttal
"but its not true!!!.The people choose the electors you vote for which ever one you think will represent you best, you would vote for them.",Rebuttal
"There could be an easy counter argument against this, since those states have probably already made up their minds on who to vote for ",Rebuttal
"But, having people know that their vote doesn't make it to actually voting for the president makes them not as ethuisiastic about voting.",Rebuttal
it's the mere fact that WE aren't making much of a difference,Rebuttal
"True this system has worked for many years but it is time for a change. People are starting to think it is unfair and really poinless to even vote when the president they want will possibly not win anyway.
",Rebuttal
"but not always , theres a high unlikely chance that there would be more popular votes for one president like in texas for john kerry that all 34 electors would go to congress and vote for john kerry thats insane. ",Rebuttal
"but if you keep the electoral college alot of people prefer vote for their president and at the same time they know they are voting for their electorals so they think is better beacuse maybe their electorals are pretty good like their presindent.
",Rebuttal
"but there are

34,500,000

people in California alone that are being disregarded and not counted for anything more than the 500,000 in Wyoming. ",Rebuttal
"Even though the Electoral College has produces some good results, presidents being elected through popular vote will be better, more efficient, and more equal. ",Rebuttal
"However this has happened before where there has been more of a ""tie",Rebuttal
With popular vote you wouldn't have to have a run off because there is not an even number of people registered to vote in America. So i urge the popular vote to take the place of the electorial college system. ,Rebuttal
"This outlook is littered with flaws,",Rebuttal
it is the not most accurate form of voting. ,Rebuttal
Even though this system has it's down side it also helps them in a lot of ways. this stops you form having a popular vote meaning more then just two parties can send their rep. ,Rebuttal
with that being said with the presidents trying to run for president the will actually try to reach the peoples needs to meet there satisfactory. the swing states is sayiong that there one state isnt going to decide the whole election.                    ,Rebuttal
but that is an opion.  Their are meany rational reasons about why the Electoral College is benificaial rather then destructive.,Rebuttal
The Electoral College assures that the President isnt just wanted in one area that is wanted all around the country.  Electoral Colleges assure that the President is wanted in many differt parts of the United States.,Rebuttal
but this may actually determine the election. ,Rebuttal
but the probility of that happening is not likely. ,Rebuttal
i think thats far more organized than for everyone to go through a process on a computer or something  ,Rebuttal
"However, thats why there is representatives. They break the tie on who to become president.
",Rebuttal
their is a couple of downsides ,Rebuttal
I believe the Electoral College is an overrated nor practical. ,Rebuttal
this method also cant get any more fair because the people vote who they want and whoever has more votes then they win. whats not fair about that? ,Rebuttal
" In a situation like this, it doesn't even matter what the popular vote results are becasue the College still gets their unique say in the presidency. However, if we got rid of the Electoral College it wouldn't matter if there was a tie in the popular votes because it could just be disputed in Congress, the same way it would be handled if there were to be a tie in the current Electoral College",Rebuttal
"I think that it does not matter if Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the AFL-CIO all want to Abolish the electoral college ",Rebuttal
 but I think it will just cause problmes. We would have to make new rules to when it comes to voting which could take a long time because we would have to have he approval of many people. Then everyone would have to learn these rules and the age to vote could be possibly changed.,Rebuttal
"However that is very rare, and only happens maybe once a century. In source three the author stated that in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than George Bush, it was the first time since 1888 that the electoral college didn't side with the popular vote. It is very possible, but very unlikely",Rebuttal
The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors and thaat those electors could always the will of the people ,Rebuttal
"but that defeats the whole purpose of the Electoral Votes.
",Rebuttal
electoral college is not fair to the people because they dont get as much say as representatives and popular votes,Rebuttal
it is regarded as an anachronism. It is non-democratic and i believe it is unfair ,Rebuttal
but maybe it's time for a change. ,Rebuttal
Then ask yourself what would really be the harm of ingoring the Electoral College. It only would make the outcome clearer. ,Rebuttal
"it is not, for it is one of the things that keep our counntry in near perfect shape",Rebuttal
"In my opinon, I urge you to ask yourself. Can you really trust these electors?",Rebuttal
"I completely disagee with this because what mathematial, tangible, or hard core evidense is there to physically prove that the people in toss-up sates are more thoughful that the people who aren't. I think that candidates should go to states that have more people that are the opposite party. ",Rebuttal
 but the way they do things makes it fair game. It keeps the system balanced.,Rebuttal
Just because not everyone pays close attention to the competing campaign. It doesn't been they shouldn't be treated differently than the ones who do. Everyone should be treated equally no matter what there opinion or choice is. ,Rebuttal
"But in reality, it is just as easy to tie in the Electoral College. Its happened recently too, in 1888 and again in 2000",Rebuttal
"Despite the reasons the electoral college is still the unfair, outdated, and irrational system it could be. ",Rebuttal
" this is false.  As Americans vote they vote for a slate of electors, which definitly creates a loss of the opposing or minority votes. ",Rebuttal
"but in this modern age of knowledge, people can be trusted to choose a leader that shares in the best interests of our country.",Rebuttal
The bad thing is knowyone really votes for the president with an electoral college ,Rebuttal
"This says that situations like this are very rare, yet it is still possible. Even so, wouldn't you rather the people be heard rather than a politician that claims to represent his state? ",Rebuttal
"but I really think we should even though it has some flaws, here is my three reasons why.
",Rebuttal
"Although I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be discontinued, I do resspect the other side's opinions and mean no disrepect. ",Rebuttal
"Of Course a dispute over the outcome is possible, it did happen in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. However, it can be argued that this method can turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, ",Rebuttal
"on the other hand, every voter's vote plays a big part to their state's electoral vote.",Rebuttal
I think that this system of electing president is still not perfect or will never be perfect ,Rebuttal
""" But this country should be about how the people vote, a popular vote would be the same, no region would have enough eligeable voters to elect a president, so a candidate would have to campaign all over the country. ",Rebuttal
Indeed there maybe limited control for the people over voting for their canidate;but the electors usually pick whoever the people voted for ,Rebuttal
" Honestly I dont see it as that ""wrong"" but thats my opinion.
",Rebuttal
This doesn't help the real problems at hand like the time management and majority issues in the states that have large amounts of people and little land and vis versa. The amount of votes each state gets is based on its population and its not fair to the staets that have less people just because of there location to suffer while the smaller more populos states don't. ,Rebuttal
" But even with this said, it's an unlikeble chance. when you vote, the elector you voted for is most likely going to be an elector which will vote for your president. ",Rebuttal
but it has become very outdated and unequal,Rebuttal
"but the election is not meant to give each state an equalized vote, it is meant to give the population of america an even representation. ",Rebuttal
you cant simply trust somebodys word like that expessualy now in days ,Rebuttal
this quote explains how canidates can not get majority rule over the other canidate. Electoral College should be replaced with majority rule,Rebuttal
i disagee because the likely hood of a tie in the first place when doing popular vote is extremely low and it does not out weight the fact that the people should elect there president. ,Rebuttal
"While in some aspects this can be true, but if the electors know what they are doing and are willing to stay true to their country, then maybe the correct person would be elected in. ",Rebuttal
"While yes, the Electoral College is very old, it does have its uses. It is perhaps one of the final things that will determine what direction this great country gets set into, be it forwards or backwards. ",Rebuttal
"But of  course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about 1/2 the eligible American population did vote in the [2012's] election",Rebuttal
These reasons still dont give us any solutions. ,Rebuttal
but can turn into a complete disaster factor.,Rebuttal
"Although these reasons may be valid, they're not enough to pursuade thousands of U.S citizens that the Electoral College should not be abolished.
",Rebuttal
"Thus, the Electoral College has some beneficial outcomes, but the popular vote is a better choice for our system of choosing the President. ",Rebuttal
"but if not me, listen to the rest of our country. ",Rebuttal
"but the Electoral College has been in effect for over 200 years, established by the founding fathers themselves in the Constitution, so why not trust that they knew what they were doing? Besides, when each party selects a slate of electors, they put their trust, which, might I add, is rarely betrayed.",Rebuttal
"Even so, that was the first time since 1888, as said in paragraph 16. ",Rebuttal
Electors are just an easier and more equal way of distributing the votes and electing a president. Only in rare cases has the electoral vote overruled the popular vote.,Rebuttal
it still does not satisify the voters ,Rebuttal
"but let me tell you something, YOU'RE WRONG!!!!!",Rebuttal
"however why would we not instead just have an extra group of say, 50 people to vote if we end up with a tie? ",Rebuttal
But what about the sates who arent caught up to the political races and would like to know more about it. They may feel disenfranchised- to feel that their votes don not matter. They may feel the new presiodent may disregard their interest and is not interested in being everyone's president.,Rebuttal
"But who's to say it can happen again. The Electoral College is a chance being taken that you may or may not win the election based on how many popular votes said person may recieve. This is no shocker that there have been disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote, its based on winner-takes-all basis.",Rebuttal
"The electoral college is very fair when it comes to the election of a president, because we all want to choose the best candidate for the job, and the only way to do that is to have an effective system for choosing a candidate without having a biased opinion tossed into the mix to mess up the process.",Rebuttal
"This means that no state has more power than another in this process, and every representative has the same amount of power when it comes down to chooosing a candidate best suited for being president. Additionally, it creates a sense of balance between all of the states and nobody has an unfair advantage when electing the next president. ",Rebuttal
then there are the people who know their rights and want to be able to have full popularity vote of who their presedent is.,Rebuttal
"But even if it did happen, as it claims in Source 1, by the Office of the Federal Registar, there would be the House of Representatives to also give the last vote if there were to be a tie.",Rebuttal
"Even so, it would be hard to tell. For the most part, it is the unfairness of not counting the peoples thoughts and opinions. It is their country as well! ",Rebuttal
"The comment that voters in swing states are more thoughtful is vague (not all voters in swing states have to be media literic), and it is unfair to other states if only the swing states are important to the canidates. Other states will not get enough and fair information about the presidental canidates. ",Rebuttal
"But even thought Bradfort disagrees with the method, Bradfort still stated the obvious. In the article Plumer states "" taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency"". Although Plumer disagree with the electoral college, Bradford still notices on how the electoral college makes a huge difference.",Rebuttal
"Now no one would know if this is true but the electors might have their reasons. But Richard A. Posner comes back and states ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. In this quote its supports the fact that the electors do choose who they please. Plus this makes it fair because candidates wont be getting votes all over the places. Also the electoral college will be trust wirthy because the college follows the majority of the people's vote, and then makes a vaild decision.",Rebuttal
But it really isn't balanced.,Rebuttal
"While in a truly direct vote, this could happen, the Electoral College allows for the same exact problem.",Rebuttal
"But of course no voter's vote swings a naional election, and spite of that about one-half the eligible American population did vote in [2012's] election.",Rebuttal
how can u say that now after years and years of this going on.  It advoids problems of elections.,Rebuttal
"The Electoral college is not the best way to choose, it has minimum chances of succeeding in the future. I think a direct vote would work the best for the voters but yet the the electoral college has its cons. ",Rebuttal
The electoral college is unfair to voters ,Rebuttal
But why do they get to vote for them and we dont. ,Rebuttal
"The Electoral College gets into all the questions and discuss who would be the best, however, a popular vote would just be that the person is their favorite just like the Electoral College.",Rebuttal
"but I think it's a way to keep everything organized and it won't cause to much chaos, unless you disagree with it. ",Rebuttal
but this dispute is less likely to happen over a dispute over the popoular vote.,Rebuttal
it is still quirky and disfunctionable at times.,Rebuttal
"I don't see this as balancing anything. Now the smaller states have an advantage over the bigger states, so you still have the same problem you began with. ",Rebuttal
"but Plumer clearly contradicts this in his article. He states ""  ... seventeen states didn't see the campaign at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad.""  The proof is irrefutable, the Electoral College has it's loop holes which seem fairly easy to get through. The system is outdated, it's time for a new system to take its spot.
",Rebuttal
 But it's less likly then a dispute over the popular vote,Rebuttal
"You are wrong in so many levels sir. the electoral college does not exclude democracy, it promotes it!",Rebuttal
The best arguments in favor of the electoral college not being good are mostly assertions withiout much basis in reality.,Rebuttal
the process is not very fair and does not bring the right people to be elected as electors.,Rebuttal
"However, notice how it says the ""electors elect the president"" yet the people elect the electors. So yes, it is not fully democratic yet still has somewhat qualities of a democracy process. ",Rebuttal
"These are all pros of keeping the Electroral College, but are they really worth it? Would you rather have these pros compared to having fairness? ",Rebuttal
"Although I argue so. The people living in the country or city has the equal amount of chance to be heared and be represented by talented, intelligent,and trustworthy people. ",Rebuttal
"its not that big of a deal unless the people you have counting votes cannot count over 538, then ok those are some pretty stupid people you should send them back to school. My grandpa at age 70 can count much better than that. ",Rebuttal
"This was only once, If the system changes then this could happen more than many more times. Then soon we won't even know which president wins the election. ",Rebuttal
"but how many more mistakes are they going to make in the future. Will there be so many, that our entire political system becomes corrupt. The citizens of the United States should be allowed to represent themselves with their own vote, and choose their own leaders. ",Rebuttal
some points can be made about the popular vote as well ,Rebuttal
"When in fact, as Bradford Plumer points out in paragraph 9, ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". ",Rebuttal
when in fact smaller states still are not treated the same as states with more electoral votes. ,Rebuttal
But a tie is highly unlikely ,Rebuttal
Some people might argue about this. It should be the more thoughtful voters that are able to vote. ,Rebuttal
"However, in source three by Richard A. Posner paragraph twenty three states ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference.""",Rebuttal
"However, it has been proven that mostly everyone does choose for the right candidate! They choose the candidate they see the post potential and confidence in and the one that is going to make the changes they want and need.",Rebuttal
"In my opinion, this is exactly the problem. The american people have the right to do a tie breaker not the electoral college. ",Rebuttal
but nothings ever gonna be just the way you want right?,Rebuttal
But of Course no voter's vote swings a national election American population did vote in 2012 election,Rebuttal
But their still wrong because electoral voting has caused many problem for us in the past and how dont we know it will not cause them in the future. that why we should change our way of voting. ,Rebuttal
 But the Electoral College simplifies that problem with the electoral votes. ,Rebuttal
"It understandable why the electoral college should be abolished; it is unreliable and unfair. However, we cannot abolish the only logical and reasonable way of electing our persidents.
",Rebuttal
"however, chaning to election by popular vote will cause mant disputes and it is not the right way to keep everyone satisfied with voting for a new president. Keeping the Electoral College is more realistic.",Rebuttal
"These accusations may be true in a sense but what is to be expected if they dont account for as much or maybe they are already accounted for as ""decided"", as stated by Richard P. Would you campaign in a place like that? ",Rebuttal
" many people disagree saying its a great system involving easy and fair processes.
",Rebuttal
but with that certainty comes many votes and state votes that were disregarded.,Rebuttal
we still have some smart people who can vote for themselves. ,Rebuttal
The problem with is htat electors can vote for whom ever they want. Some go against the cnadidate they are supposed to vote for. So voters are chosing the president they want. ,Rebuttal
"But that was the first time since 1888.
",Rebuttal
"the benifits outweigh the detriments immensly.
",Rebuttal
This is surely an opinion as he is just trying to deride the Electoral College. However majority of states vote in favor of the Electoral College anyway. It gives a simple vote to people and produces a clear winner.,Rebuttal
"He thinks that one representitive cant speak for his region, but thats why they vote right? He represents the majority supplimenting a clear representation of his state/region. ",Rebuttal
"How can it be so obsolete if it is presently working out. The Electoral College is giving the vote meaning and depth in that it gives voters the choice of president and his electors. The Office of the Fedral Register informs us ""You help choose you state's electors when you vote for your president""(Source 1 paragraph 6). This gives the voters more voting power as the get to help choose other things in goverment. ",Rebuttal
" It is not really a compromise when you have a system in which a president can win the popular vote by 99 percent of the people but still lose by the electoral college because we basically have no say in the election.
",Rebuttal
"however, the method is actually turning off potential voters for a candidate. The popular vote allows every voter to express their opinions because the overall vote chooses the puopular president. ",Rebuttal
"and I cant change your mind but only tell you that there are things wroung with the Electoral College. One problem with it is that the electors can be anyonenot holding public office. Another problem with it is that each state only casts one vote, A single representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters whould have as much to say as the 55 representatives from Califorina who represent 35 million voters. Thats why I think we dont need the Electoral College. ",Rebuttal
"there is still the risk of repeating history to a greater extent.
",Rebuttal
 nonetheless a single voter`s vote. ,Rebuttal
" I feel that because of some of the people that are allowed to be elected into Congress, the United States should leave it up to the rest of the population to elect the president. ",Rebuttal
"their are many pros that keep this system alive.
",Rebuttal
It's quite simply one vote makes one person win the presidentcy.,Rebuttal
The Electoral has its flaws but so does the popluar vote.,Rebuttal
"Sadly, very few people find the Electoral College useful but they do do a lot of things that help make the elections easier on the voters and putting less pressure on the candidates. ",Rebuttal
What they fail to realize is that those citizens may not even know who they are voting for! It is lucid that there is simply no valid argument for outting the fate of the presidency into the hands of a couple swing voters in a state.,Rebuttal
there is a certainty of outcome to it ,Rebuttal
it is likely an arguement about the popular vote. ,Rebuttal
It's better for the country that we don't change The Electoral College,Rebuttal
but they done fixed all that things going well. ,Rebuttal
"The Electoral college is one by far the best things, It dont need to be taken from us. Many good things the college does. ",Rebuttal
"My belief about the Elecotral College differs. I believe it is unfair and outdated, and I am not alone on that opinion",Rebuttal
"On the other hand, it would be much more difficult to tie a popular vote, seeing that there are far more citizens than electors for the college. ",Rebuttal
"However, the process is unfair as well ",Rebuttal
The way we are voting now has no problems so far,Rebuttal
Why would you even be ok with taking such a chance? It's better to be one-hundred percent sure of what will happen instead of ninety-five percent ,Rebuttal
"but to count each state rather than each and every single vote is much easier nowadays.  Counting such a plurality of votes is already a difficulty, even right here in the Sun Shine State.  Imagine counting all the votes right down to the last one!  Even though a tie is more likely this way, the odds of a tie are so rare, what does it matter? ",Rebuttal
"but this does not happen often.  Usually, it does not cause too much of a balance tipping. ",Rebuttal
"these incidents do not happen all the time.  To fret over such things only offers you more problems and less solutions.  By having an elector, a representative, someone can't say something stupid and pull the whole country down with him.  Instead, this is the best way to address the majority of the people without conflict. ",Rebuttal
but over recent study some people are beginning to become more fond of the popular voting method. ,Rebuttal
Through reading a select amount of articles I have picked up more recent and destructive faults within the electoral college voting method. ,Rebuttal
"In all honesty, if it was going to be as worse... then it wouldve. But it did not so why they spend so much time stressing about something that does not exist. ",Rebuttal
"IF a tie were to appear, i doubt very much that it will happen because the people campaign for the president they want in the White house, so they persuade people causing one to have most votes. But in all worst cases, that is why there is a Vice-President. The Vice-President serves a purpose and should be treated like so. ",Rebuttal
 i think popular vote would be a lot more fair than Electoral College. ,Rebuttal
but it would get the job done in no time. ,Rebuttal
but it has been working in the country since the founding farthers. ,Rebuttal
That still doesn't change the fact of how unfair it is to the voters. ,Rebuttal
But then theres advantages,Rebuttal
 In whatever case it may be it's not fair to people having their own votes being rejected. Like i said in my previous paragraph everyone should have a saying on whom they want their president to be. ,Rebuttal
"Although,

not everyone might get the candidate that they had hoped for originally ",Rebuttal
"However,

this is only based on the candidate that has the most popular votes.

There are various reasons to consider the electoral college but many of them are followed by an overload of reasons

NOT

to keep the electoral college in use. ",Rebuttal
"it does not mean something so sinister as toying with the election system could not happen and with great costs. Considering it has already happened once when John F. Kennedy ran for presidency, how can we not assume it might not happen again? And even if such happenings may take decades to occur again, what of the electors that did not swear themselves to the vote they had claimed to have chosen in the first place?",Rebuttal
This reasoning is highly probably and has never happened before.                          ,Rebuttal
"Voters dont vote for the presidant when they vote, they vote for the elcectors and the electors vote for the presidant. This can mean that even if you voted for the specific presidant your vote shows you voted for the 30 or so congress people voting for presidant.",Rebuttal
"What if there was a tie in the electoral vote then the election would be for the House of Representitves where they vote for presidant. The 55 representitive votes are equal to 35 million voters. This shows that the electoral college can be bad for the voters.
",Rebuttal
"times have changed. Scandals have taken place, and issues have risen. But yet we still use this process even though we have an election all it does it we elect a select few to represent us.",Rebuttal
Many will believe this because their not able to see the big picture.,Rebuttal
"but they don't know what it's all about.
",Rebuttal
"but that's their call the VOTERS call, if they don't want to participate in the voting it's partially their fault the candidate they favor doesn't get selected. ",Rebuttal
" Think about it... do you really think the electors would vote for who they are suppose to vote for? No ! They are independent, they can do whatever they want.",Rebuttal
 even though he still would've won it would've been more fair to let the popular votes decide ,Rebuttal
but to me that could be bad beacause what if who we choose actually has good ideas the college wouldve just go for the other guy. ,Rebuttal
 there are more cons in the situation ,Rebuttal
yet they do not realize what this system has provided for us. ,Rebuttal
"Although the Electoral College has been working for a long time, that is the only thing that America has tried ",Rebuttal
but we have chosen them and they are more informed on this compromise so they should  be entitled as two votes.,Rebuttal
But in the case of the Elctoral College system the bad outways the good.,Rebuttal
but it's  less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.,Rebuttal
Well thats a simple one because yes it can happen but its as rare as someone who puts ketchup on pizza. And if they dont know the facts about who is who maybe they shouldnt be voting because seriously like i said dont just vote to vote you should vote if you know information about what you are doing and who you are voting for snd most importantly why?,Rebuttal
"but thats not tru according to the

Electoral College

. The have electors and there Electors can just flip that decision upside down and it would be the opposite representative who would get the vote, but then again the eletors of the

Electoral College can be the opposite of your favor.",Rebuttal
but its time to just get rid of it. Im quite sure citizens of america don't like feeling like they have no say what so ever.,Rebuttal
"In conlusion, i dont agree with this, there is almost nothing i can think of that is good about this, unfortunutely. ",Rebuttal
"In despised of the Electoral College cons, here is five reasons of keeping this method of choosing our President. Certainty of Outcome, Everyone's President, Swing States, Big states, and Avoid run-off elections.",Rebuttal
it dosent reallly stand out as the people do.,Rebuttal
"these people may be right, but for the many past presidents that it has successfully elected, either for the good or bad, we the people are the main power for it.",Rebuttal
It is all a phsycological insecurity for those who haven't gotten used to the fact that they don't have a direct power over what they want for the well-being of the government and the citizens ,Rebuttal
it works unlike any other system of election that has been thought of ,Rebuttal
"but then again thats very rare.
",Rebuttal
"If the vote for the abolishment of the Electoral College does happen, then there is nothing that I can do about it, but you can still change your ways. You can make it fair and not irrational.",Rebuttal
" If the government had only done the right thing and elected what the people wanted, then no one would have a problem with the Electoral College. It is stupid that the government is listening to what we have to say but not hearing it completly.",Rebuttal
but in reality everybody has to vote anyway ,Rebuttal
"but as time is pasing, it keeps getting better and having less issues because they have a modern techonology, thats now is taking care of the votes and keeping it orgainze. ",Rebuttal
removing the Electoral college will be more bemeficial at the end of the day. ,Rebuttal
"but, in the eyes of others, it may seem ""Unfair, outdated and irrational."" Says Bradford Plumer. ",Rebuttal
"Everyone desevere their take on the subject of matter. There's an adge saying "" the one's you don't expects to learn from, can teach you the most"". After all it is our right to vote, as it is promise in the Constitution ",Rebuttal
The electoral collage is overall unfair to voters becuse of the winner takes all system in each state,Rebuttal
"But knowing the vote isnt going to effect anything, such as Republicans in Texas or Democrats in California they have less incentive to pay attention to a campaign then to care if there president were to be picked. As stated in Source three paragraph twenty three ""this is why voters in Presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote can decide an election.",Rebuttal
" but those who say that are those who are afraid of change, those who are blinded by the wrongdoings of the electoral college. ",Rebuttal
"However, I believe that the popular vote is more fair because it expresses the opinion of the majority.",Rebuttal
Whe you vote for president your are actually have a part in who you would like.,Rebuttal
-I do believe that it is against our certain rights as a United States citizen not to know who exactly we are putting our faith in. ,Rebuttal
" While I am a woman of passion, I do allow myself to see both sides of the story and I think while the Electoral College can do good, it can also do bad for this country. It is outdated, overused, and wrong. ",Rebuttal
"Unlike voting by popular vote, it can cause some problems because not everyone is allowed to vote and there could be few votes for candidates which would have a negative outcome. However, it would be the same for the Electoral College because there would be not enough electors in regions. ",Rebuttal
 I strongly disagree. ,Rebuttal
"but it's something we are all used to. It would take years for us to perfect everythimg for a new voting system.
",Rebuttal
you are wrong. the electoral college is a processs in whic hgives the people wants in a state to an elector who then gives yiou an equal chance onf voting for what youo pleased ,Rebuttal
it is best that way.,Rebuttal
but really they decide who the Electoral voters choose.,Rebuttal
Although they don't have much of a say it is nice to know that people do care about the elections and do pay close attention to what is going on. ,Rebuttal
"But,We the people do not have our justice in that manner.If the winning vote is casted by state the legislatures are techinally responsible for picking the eletors in favor of the vote.",Rebuttal
"Unfortuanitly this is solved by popular vote, since it is by individual not by state. Other votes in other states balance them out.",Rebuttal
Just because most other things are equal they favor larger states. The Electoral College's method of selecting the president turns off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. ,Rebuttal
"but whats best for us might not be want we want, it might not be what we think is best for us why does are vote no longer count? ",Rebuttal
If the eclectoral college leads to a tie our votes become the tie braker but that method has never been use so why are we even voting?  ,Rebuttal
but with the results we got from this system however the results have been great this means we had failures but we had some succsess,Rebuttal
"But it also has disadvantages for example it takes so many risks, its unfair to voters, its outdated, and irrational.
",Rebuttal
"These are strawman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system ",Rebuttal
Now there are some disavantages for the people voting but not as many and not as bad. ,Rebuttal
 But to be honest why rush to fail. ,Rebuttal
"but the decesion on the president is going to mostly affect us, the people.
",Rebuttal
but the good that could come of it overlies the bad.,Rebuttal
 Even though this election was disputed it has only been one out of 50 elections. ,Rebuttal
but it is just be revised by that people that know what is best for the country. ,Rebuttal
"the chance of this happening is very small since ""even a very slight pulrality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state."" (Posner Source 3) For example, in 2012, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of electoral vote while he recieved only 51.3 percent of the popular vote.(Posner Source 3). A 1.3 percent from a tie is much, much more close than the 11.7 percent that that the Electoral College gives us. ",Rebuttal
But by saying that they're basically saying that they dont trust the Citizens in big state's to know what they're doing when voting for a President. ,Rebuttal
but what system doesnt have kinks that need to be rolled out once and a while? ,Rebuttal
Even if the Electoral Colege went away what would the government use as an effect to insinuate a new reaveling method on choosing the president? ,Rebuttal
"So you see It's not like it is perfect in every way. It just has it's problems that's all.
",Rebuttal
but when you think about they are all going to the same place in one factor.    ,Rebuttal
The electoral college has never technically failed us ,Rebuttal
To me I like it if you all would let it be the popular vote not by some college. ,Rebuttal
"I don't blame the canidates for their methods, but the electoral college itself for bringing about these techniques for campaigning. ",Rebuttal
Eventhough the text says is takes away the chance I still think it reduces it I mean look at the Bush family they did a horible job and guess who elected them the electors.,Rebuttal
"but their aren't many voters usually not voting for either a republican or democrat, proof that the electoral vote simply is an anachronism ",Rebuttal
"But it still does not change the fact that its an unfair system, the story by Richard A. Posner ""In defense of the electoral college:Five reasons to keep our despised the method of choosing the President"" explains that ""As we saw in 2012 elections.. ",Rebuttal
I mean the election is only a few swing away from catastrophe. ,Rebuttal
In order to move forward as a nation we as a whole need to make changes sometimes. Just think what it would be like today if segregation-an established rule and law- was not questioned. ,Rebuttal
but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. ,Rebuttal
"Cutting it a bit close there? Enough of that percentage of popular votes lost during the ""winner-take-all' method could change the election of the president.
",Rebuttal
"They do not realise that if we don't have the electoral college than that is is more than likely to happen because the electoral college is what allows us to have a voice, a say, in what we want in our future president.",Rebuttal
but now we do so we can only go by the popular vote. ,Rebuttal
"Therefore, the Electoral College should not be changed. ",Rebuttal
"The electoral college shouldnt have to be involved if the race isnt a tie and is going smooth. Its like sticking your nose in someones business, or getting involved in something that doesnt concern you. The electoral college is just a big insigator. ",Rebuttal
"I can see how this could support changing to election by popular vote, and how it could be reasonable. If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country. ",Rebuttal
That should never happen.,Rebuttal
"it's not quite fair to certain people in small states, etc. There are people who don't even see a point in voting now because they know that their vote will most likely not matter.",Rebuttal
"Well I think its not, it's widely regarded as a thing that seems to belong to the past but also not to fit in the president. ",Rebuttal
"There is absolutely nothing wrong with that! There may be more voters for one candidate in a certain place, but as long as the people voted for whom they want there is no injustice. ",Rebuttal
"I could truley undertsand why and this would work out, but i still strongly believe that this could be the cause to many problems. ",Rebuttal
but we should at least get a vote on like new laws or building something new in town.,Rebuttal
it is because of population. ,Rebuttal
popular vote is not as efficent as eletoral votes. ,Rebuttal
 The electoral college has been a sucessful way to choose our presidnets in the past. The elctoral college avoids the problem of elections in ehich no canidat receives a majoirty of the popual votes. ,Rebuttal
But the people who do vote are people who wanr a express a political preference rather than people who want to think that their ine singal vote will decide the over-all winner of the election.,Rebuttal
"but consider this: a swing state such as Florida with over 20 electoral votes could go to a candidate who could have won by a 51 to 49 percent margin. This means that all the voters who voted for the other candidate no longer count, making the electoral college ineffective at voicing the opinions of the populous.",Rebuttal
"However, this is not necessarily the case, and there are plenty of other well-educated voters in other states who have opinions that will never be counted because of the electoral college.",Rebuttal
 My response to that not everybody is chosen by politcal party. ,Rebuttal
" My response to that is..sometimes presidents want to be president because ""they want to change everything in the United States like ..taxes..and health insurance. For example like Obama care he has change the health insurance and people dont like that. And 2016 theres going to be a new President in the United States.    ",Rebuttal
"But plainly put, if we could just count voters as people of one nation, not individual states, we could have an efficient running election. ",Rebuttal
"Electoral college have different ways and similar ways from changing to the election by the popular for the president of United States.For example states in source one ""The Electoral College consists of the 538 electors"".""A Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.""",Rebuttal
"But, they still had a say so on who should be president and who shouldnt be president. I think that question should be answered by our own people!
",Rebuttal
"While this is true, it is also accurate, most people don't even know that they aren't even voting for the president, and their vote is only electing their state's electors. As upsetting as that is, it's mostly just like choosing a new senator or representative to represent the state. This is the same idea, our state votes for a number of people to vote for us. If we win the democratic side, democrats will vote for the democrat (they rarely betray us) candidate.
",Rebuttal
"it provides a clear system to clearly elect a new president. Candidates always try to persuade states, oftening visiting them to sway them to vote for electors that will go to elect them instead ",Rebuttal
but the popular vote is everyones say not a couple of peoples say,Rebuttal
"However, all these arguments to keep it lack good logical reasoning and are outdated. So, we should abolish the Electoral College and give the choice of the election to the people through popular vote. ",Rebuttal
"Yet it is more unfair as it states in source #

2

paragraph 12 ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote ",Rebuttal
but it takes a whole lot time for nothing really. ,Rebuttal
because it's actually very unique. This method turn off potential voters for a reason; The candidate that must be chosen is the most prepared one,Rebuttal
However many people believe it creates more of a problem than a solution.,Rebuttal
"but according to history things can happen such as in the 2000 election. Why keep a process that the majority of the citizens of this country don't want and a process that just causes issues.
",Rebuttal
"I can counter that the certainty of the vote is false due to the fiasco of Gore and Bush in 2000, as well as the concept of the House of Representatives that I mentioned earlier as well. In the factor that Posner mentioned in his point of everyone's president, I do not find this very accurate due to the reason that our vote relies on a slate of electors, not us entirely, as it would in a popular vote. In swing states, it mentions in the article of Plumer that a winner-takes-all method is unfair to voters because electors ignore states that they do not have confidence in winning the vote. A major point that I disagree with would be the point that Posner pointed out with Big States, where he mentioned that,""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" (3). In this, I would argue that this is unfair, because of the inequality of representatives due to population, which is not the voter's decision. In the statement of Avoid Run-off Elections, Posner states that, ""The Electoral College avoids that problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" (3). I find this false due to the reason that the Electoral College is based on a different amount of voters and electors in each state, which in turn is viewed unfair because there is a factor of the swing states once again, explains that some electors choose states over another which lets us show how unfair the Electoral College is, generally speaking. ",Rebuttal
"which has a higher percentage rate to tie, all of America, or 0.00000001% of the population of America? ",Rebuttal
"Really, is that why people vote? So you are saying that people vote just because they prefer, or like, the person other another candidate. So going back to my earlier point, people are just so amazed at their ""something"", that they just decide to take the effort to vote for them. No, people, that's not why, it's because they think they can make a change in the everyday world. ",Rebuttal
"But then if this ocuurs are we really choseing our president, i dont think so. Even still that is only my opinion. ",Rebuttal
it's a one-sided deal ,Rebuttal
"But it is based off of trust, that the elector won't betray the canidate's party and people. Trust. Are you really going to put your vote for the president of your country in someone eles hand based off of trust? ",Rebuttal
 but with popular vote that would almost never happen,Rebuttal
but no matter what with electoral and mpopular vote presidents are always going to go after states with more people it's a problem we can not avoid. ,Rebuttal
"I have my opinion they have theres, their gonna give you opinions  about how unfair the electoral college is when in reality its not anything thats gonna harm you. Perhaps i think its safer then choosing someone that you have no idea about the decisions they wanna make. Yes people may no be that much interested in politics because their not involved that much. They have to do whatever it takes so our nation can be a great one.",Rebuttal
however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote ,Rebuttal
"but, that only happened one time.",Rebuttal
This statement appears as a faulty reasoning to have an Electoral College because it is obsurd to remove Americans' right to vote ,Rebuttal
but it has been the best way of selecting a President ,Rebuttal
"but the electors usually make the decision the people has asked for.
",Rebuttal
What we should do is have a sort of security system that alows us the make sure our electors do the right thing ,Rebuttal
So voters in presidential elections are way better than just one vote deciding an election. ,Rebuttal
"To that I say this. As a canidate, your ultimate goal is to serve two full terms as the president of the world's leading superpower right? Why would a canidate want to lie and jeprodize their chances at doing what they feel is right for the country? ",Rebuttal
"There will still be flaws, but this is not the correct way to fix it. Listening strictly to the people's vote is what Amercia was built on and as an American I would like to see a change and let my voice be heard. If I want to vote I will vote, I don't want to vote on someone voting for me. ",Rebuttal
this is an invalid statement because the people of America don't realistically have a say in government decisions. ,Rebuttal
"But,its completely unfair to all those citizens of California who pay their taxes, work hard for their money to better their state. Take the time out in their day to vote. You're telling me that their vote doesn't have a valid say in the choosing of the President?, non sense. ",Rebuttal
"It totally contradicted itself in 2000, when the Gore had more popluar votes than Bush but yet fewer electoral votes. Bush went on to win the election and manage to destroy the country along the way as well.",Rebuttal
" These reasons are made by the people because they want more and more power in the government. What the people want is almost always the risky option, especially when the topic is government. ",Rebuttal
"Unfortunately, if the government's decisions were left in the hands of the people, the country's state would be in anarchy. ",Rebuttal
What most people are not seeing is that the direct voting and Electoral College system are very similar. ,Rebuttal
"But that is usually a rare ocasion and is easily avoided in every state. As individuals we would usually not avoid coming to vote in an election for certain positions especially when it comes to a president.
",Rebuttal
but it does not mean that it is not equal. ,Rebuttal
"That being said, sure they can't control that but the elector rarely betrays the trust of the voters,",Rebuttal
"This is far from reality, because the popular vote is vital to the Electoral College. ",Rebuttal
"However, Richard A. Posner makes a fair point: ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal.",Rebuttal
"However; the people should have the right to directly choose the candidate of his or her choice. Therefore, the elecoral college is outdated and must be eliminated.
",Rebuttal
I believe that we should not change our electorial process to popular vote and i think we should stick with the process we have now ; Elecoral College.,Rebuttal
but it's likely that a disputate over the popular vote,Rebuttal
but then again that may just be the cheaters.,Rebuttal
"they do not always vote for who they are supposed to. The slate of electors that the people vote for are supposed to be trusted to vote for what the popular vote says, they do not always do so. ",Rebuttal
"it doesnt at all, for you are not choosing which presidential candidate to vote for, you are voting for someone else to vote for the president who might not always stay true to their word and vote for a different candidate. ",Rebuttal
It all depends on how the votes are counted.,Rebuttal
but it does help ,Rebuttal
"But every vote counts, and if every voter understood why they were voting for who they were voting for then the president may be a majority favorite ",Rebuttal
but i beleive that we should get rid of it and really let the people have a voice and not have a group of people speack for us.,Rebuttal
"however, there is a explanation for this. When a person votes for a candidate using the Electoral College, they are actually voting for a slate of electors who in turn vote for a nominee. The reasoning behind this is that a larger state such as California, has a much larger population that a smaller state such as Utah. If we were to chose by popular vote, California would have a very unfair advantage over Utah. ",Rebuttal
"no one group has any advantage over another as shown here, ""All are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons."" (source 3). ",Rebuttal
"we have even allowed Columbia to vote as shown here, ""Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College."" (source 1). ",Rebuttal
but how often is that going to happen? ,Rebuttal
It'd be much easier though if we got rid of electors all together,Rebuttal
"There is no childish, frivilolus blame to be placed. Simply stated, the fault lies in our electoral college system. The candidates are just playing the game of the electoral college. ",Rebuttal
Are you saying that America doesn't have the time to recount votes to ensure the prosperity of the American people. Is that the messege you want to project? ,Rebuttal
The certainty of outcome is ludicrous as well.,Rebuttal
but it is highly unlikey to happen ,Rebuttal
but the number electoral votes should be proportional to the popular vote.,Rebuttal
"However, I would rather be in a situtation where I know my vote counted for the president, than use the Electoral College and avoid ties that could still happen. ",Rebuttal
There aren't many of them but i believe that they are needed to keep the College going and allowing it to vote the right way instead of the wrong way. ,Rebuttal
This sums up that the process is unfair to many of the states voters and must be changed to become more open and share the equality with those who are losing thier trust. ,Rebuttal
However this relies on a winner takes all system which makes the say of the minority voters pointless since even if they do vote then their vote is pointless. ,Rebuttal
"That being said, it shows that the voters' vote do not really matter, because it all comes down to the electoral votes. ",Rebuttal
"but, was less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example the 2012 election, with Obama received a 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to Romney vote 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast.",Rebuttal
but the ones who did win are doing what they believe is right. Just because of one big out break in 2000 doesn't mean the system will fail again.,Rebuttal
"which always avoid all the bad the electoral college does and only focus on the so called ""good"".",Rebuttal
"However, thye elctorial college can even decrease the percentage of voters in the country. There are Democrats in Texas while California has Republicans. ",Rebuttal
The Electoral College is a good thing.,Rebuttal
"but there are too many factors to that. We must take into full recognition that electors do not have to be faithful toward the end to the President they were going to vote for in the beginning. We must also consider the fact that the Electors are people not in public Office. I am assuming that means that they must work for the government rather than in the public. I must state the possibility that there could very well be some possible, underhanded things going on in the government for the assurance that a particular Presidential Candidate is chosen to win the election,",Rebuttal
"However, the government was made for the public and therefor, I do believe that the people should choose their president as long as everyone is completely informed with uncensored information aboutb how everything is run, what that President, as well as what Congress and the other branches of Government intend to do whilst the current President is in Office. ",Rebuttal
"there is however some flaws to these so called ""pros"". Faithless electors exist. These electors totally ignore what the people have to say and cast their own vote.",Rebuttal
"But, no voter's vote swings a national election.  Which means about one-half of the Americans eligible to vote, did not.  People that vote are people who want to express their political preference, rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. ",Rebuttal
 but there is more negatives on keeping it.,Rebuttal
What we dont know is if it will permanantly work for our governmental system and is it worth the risk ,Rebuttal
"Although that is true, that is only one problem that would be resolved by the electoral college, and olne benefit is outnumbered by the numerous disadvantages to the electoral college. ",Rebuttal
"This quote shows that a dispute is more likely to occur over popular vote. On the contary, it is unfair for the electoral college to cast votes for the people. ",Rebuttal
but in reality it does to the Electors of your state.,Rebuttal
"This keeps the process shorter, but not as short as it would be in the popular vote system",Rebuttal
if its so good why do you so many issues with things that happen to people ,Rebuttal
but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote ,Rebuttal
" it also allows people to lose intrest since their votes don't effect much in the long run. the votes of the people should effect who should be in office because with what I know about the Electoral College, it could break a country. It takes away freedom of speech. But helps the canidate(s) from your state , which can possibly help your state in the long run . ",Rebuttal
None the less even if the government fixed the so called problems people would always find something they do not like about the electoral college,Rebuttal
that doesn't mean its still valid.,Rebuttal
" it simply isn't a fair way to go about having an election. Voters should each have the same impact, and they would have exactly that in a direct election ",Rebuttal
"This notion is simply a fabrication in order to make the Electoral College seem as if it causes America to be more informed, because there would be no need for residents of specific states to pay closer attention to candidates than residents of others if a direct election were to take place. The Electoral College does not properly reflect the desire of the nation's population, and thus should be replaced. ",Rebuttal
"However, the College Electoral process has more cons then pros.  With the electoral college system voters vote for the slate of electors not president. Millions of votes casted in each state are practically forgotten about after one of the electors win the statewide election.",Rebuttal
yet these arguments are founded on little reason. ,Rebuttal
"However, in 1979 in Ohio, it would have only taken a few thousand voters to vote the other way (12). ",Rebuttal
"is rather incorrect. Single votes could absolutely sway an election, as mentioned earlier. ",Rebuttal
"but it would free voters from an obselete and untrustworthy system. Over 60 percent of voters oppose the Electoral College (9) which is enough to bring attention to these facts and, hopefully, address them before another controversial occurance. ",Rebuttal
"In counterclaim of the good attributes of the electoral college voting system we could still state that the 'popular vote' method is still a much more equal, fair, accurate, and durable way of voting for the president of the United States.       ",Rebuttal
"Even thogh these reasons oppose my claim as stated in source 2

the electoral college is unfair, oudated and irrational. ",Rebuttal
"What many forget to realize is that the Electoral College is a Presidium for the elections, it presides over and gives the real vote in the elections because it comprises of random people representing both the states and the states' populations ",Rebuttal
"In Source 3, the article states that it is is less likely to have a dispute over the popular vote. ""The reason is the winning canidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" Saying that the Electoral College sometimes tries to go along with the popular vote to best fit what the people voted for. ",Rebuttal
but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote ,Rebuttal
"But, each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote ",Rebuttal
"but when voter numbers don't have a huge difference apart, I don't like what the elector ",Rebuttal
"if a kid gets caught, probably just chatting because they are bored, just confiscate the phone make the parent come to pick it up ",Rebuttal
"All though, they can be solved by different disciplinary tactics, like detention ",Rebuttal
"But some students don't have phones, so don't think to hard about this ",Rebuttal
than your job as a principle would be to take that privilege away from them and then there would be no phones allowed in school.,Rebuttal
this is another instance you do not want ,Rebuttal
"This would be a valid concern, but students already text during class and they get in trouble for it; so i believe that it would be no different than it is now in terms of students texting in class.",Rebuttal
This too would not be too much of an issue because if there is any cyber bullying going on than it could be punishable. ,Rebuttal
"However I think that is a price to pay sometimes.
",Rebuttal
what happens if our family have a emergency and they need to get in touch with they son or daughter they can call or text and tell us was going on ,Rebuttal
 just give us a try to see how it works with us students. and if you don like it you can change it back,Rebuttal
"As I said earlier, as a student I like policy one better",Rebuttal
but at other times cell phones can be a help to student and faculty.,Rebuttal
 Students phones must be turned off during class.,Rebuttal
but they still haven't done any harm to the American society. ,Rebuttal
but I don't think completely banning them from the school is such a good idea. ,Rebuttal
How else would they be able to communicate with them.,Rebuttal
If they did not have any classes together before then they could easily text each other in between class periods and find out a time that they could both work on the project. ,Rebuttal
"well your wrong because when young adults have the time to themselves using their phones and sending texts during their free time ,why would they need to talk to someone later?",Rebuttal
you can make sure that all phones are off during the class period and may be turned on when the class period is over.,Rebuttal
"But that's the thing, we can't!",Rebuttal
But it was their fault for letting them know about where you keep your phone in your locker.,Rebuttal
i would really perfume we do have our cells phone in school. and i am not just saying this b. cause i am a teenage and i am a student in SCHOOL_NAME ,Rebuttal
but it dose not hurt 2 TRY. but if the student phone continues 2 turn on and off there is a possibility the phone will get messed up by turning on and off .,Rebuttal
"If you can keep your grades and conduct up and well, then I think you deserve to have and use your cell phone. If you don't do your work and have a bad conduct, I don't think you should be able to have that privilege when you are already violating the basics to school and its rules. ",Rebuttal
I don't believe this to be true because they're using cell phones in free times.,Rebuttal
"Policy 2 is unfair, and could cause student to break that policy, and not like school because they feel that it is a ""Stupid"" or ""Unreasonable"" rule.",Rebuttal
"I know this one school where the students put their phones on the teachers desk before the test, and they get it back as soon as its done. I belive that",Rebuttal
the only way we can fix that problem is take away their phone privileges during school.,Rebuttal
"but as long as you enforce the seconds part of the policy which is, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, it shouldn't be a distraction. ",Rebuttal
but not during the time your supposed to learn. ,Rebuttal
is not really going to help.,Rebuttal
but it really isn't students don't mean to be rude.,Rebuttal
"but you can avoid that by keeping it on you at all times and to take an extra step you could get a tracker on it. Being in a catholic school, we learn about morals and how stealing is a sin. I doubt anyone would have the audacity to go against the commandments and take another student's phone.",Rebuttal
I think just about every student would like to have their cell phone in school ,Rebuttal
will there can be a punishment to that person that dose not flow the rules. ,Rebuttal
 But part of the faculties job is to protect from the outside danger. ,Rebuttal
but you can just simply make a rule that if you do use them in class you will have to buy a new one or something,Rebuttal
but if the student needs to call a parent for a reason that's not an emergency ;the student should just ask permission to call from the office phone. Phones are a big distraction to a learning environment and it will hinder the student if allowed to be used in a school ,Rebuttal
"but just telling the students to turn the phone of is not enough,",Rebuttal
but if you ban phones from school it will go completely overboard. ,Rebuttal
but if we turn them off then we can turn our whole attention to the teacher and the lesson.,Rebuttal
but they can leave them in their pocket and turn the ringer off.,Rebuttal
but most of the students will be responsible and keep there phone in there back packs turned off. ,Rebuttal
"Allowing them to use their cell phones during lunch and free time will have the opposite affect of what is meant of Policy 1.
",Rebuttal
"most of the time these are occupied by others who may not have a cellular device, and if you have to ask something quickly, there is just no time.",Rebuttal
"Even if every single phone is unavailable and all the teacher's cell phones have been gotten rid of somehow, it is very rare. So rare in fact, that I don't believe it to be an issue ",Rebuttal
But at other times its not because i always see teachers using their phones. So why can't we? ,Rebuttal
If the principal allows students to bring cell phones to school he should led the upper grades to bring cell phones. ,Rebuttal
students at school and adults at work can get distracted bye a cell phone. ,Rebuttal
but I also think it is unfair for the student to not have any person freedom during class.,Rebuttal
But if the rule happened to be changed then it would keep a lot of problems from starting.,Rebuttal
"but changeable by, reprimanding them, which may help the problem ",Rebuttal
So let them bring there phones to school.,Rebuttal
but if they do and they get caught they should get in trouble for it. I really don't see a problem with taken your phone to school and using it at free time. ,Rebuttal
 I think by high school most kids will be mature enough to understand that phones should not be a distraction during class. ,Rebuttal
"Like I said before, by high school most students are mature enough to focus on their work instead of their phone, but still we should get some free time with it ",Rebuttal
"but I still think Policy 1 is best. Although cell phones can be very annoying to teachers and fellow students, they are very helpful also ",Rebuttal
"If we were able to text at lunch and have our phones off while in your other classes, kids would pay more attention and learn more ",Rebuttal
but what about the others.,Rebuttal
So to tell the truth it really doesn't matter to me if the principle picks policy 1 or 2. ,Rebuttal
"But people would text even more and have their cell phones out way more if we had that rule at school. It would be chaos, kids getting in trouble day after day because of their cell phones.",Rebuttal
"But me along with the rest of the students of SCHOOL_NAME

would really appreciate it if you would change the rule, ",Rebuttal
As long as they don't use it in class you should let them to bring a cell phone to school.,Rebuttal
allowing them to bring it would be a lot better.,Rebuttal
but not all students,Rebuttal
incase a student forgets something at home or has an accident they can call there parents or who ever to come and help them. ,Rebuttal
Cell phones are a way for students to relax and spend their free time ,Rebuttal
but just by letting them know that there is a time for cell phones might help them think twice.,Rebuttal
"Therefore if students are not turning off their phones, disrupting class, and being a class distraction, I believe that it's your duty to take away that cell phone privilege. Only returning to policy 1 when you believe that they can handle it. ",Rebuttal
"On the other hand , policy 2 would just eliminate the problem straight forward. making texting during a class impossible. ",Rebuttal
" but at the same time ,",Rebuttal
when if you let us use them we will obey the rule and respect you by actually letting us use them so then we will listen and we will know you understand we are actually obsessed with them ,Rebuttal
then there should be no problem why we cain't bring them to school ,Rebuttal
" it is much easier for kids to just use their phones.
",Rebuttal
 I disagree for many reasons.,Rebuttal
"It would be better if we were just allowed to have our phones out, instead of having a handful of students in detention for texting. ",Rebuttal
but we do it anyways so why not just let us do it in the open ,Rebuttal
But having the right to use a cell phone during lunch period or any other free time would not affect that at all. ,Rebuttal
"If you enforced Policy 1 most students wouldn't be using them in class, for they can use them in free time and during lunch. Having the opportunity to use them in free time would make students more motivated to finish their work, and get things done. ",Rebuttal
"But what is the point of having your phone out, if you were walking and texting you get walk into somebody and get hurt walking into something like a wall",Rebuttal
i can understand that matter but for just bring your phone to school do not approve of that because like i said its a big detraction to others you might not think it is but it is.,Rebuttal
then that's when you can move on to your second policy but you will never find out what will happen unless you try to see if the students can handle it .They need to know this a privilege that there getting to take out there phones,Rebuttal
there are many more and better reasons why they should.,Rebuttal
"but, I think if you do go with policy 1 you would get a lot more trouble then just going with policy 2.",Rebuttal
that they should take them away from the people using them at that time and return them at the end of the day.,Rebuttal
"But there is no need to do that at school it all goes back to the same point, students have time out of school to do it so why don't they do it then? At school they see their friends. There is no need to converse with them on the phone when you can do it face to face.
",Rebuttal
On the other hand the phones are turned off so they cant get any calls or text ,Rebuttal
 but in reality if we don't have the privilege we will do trickery and do it any way without the teachers privilege.,Rebuttal
so there should be some sort of points system where you have to have a certain amount of points to get the privilege of phones ,Rebuttal
But if you let us use them during brakes and lunch we will not use them during class we will wait until brake or lunch time ,Rebuttal
I believe that kids are more responsible. ,Rebuttal
"But there's also reasons you should bring it to school.
",Rebuttal
But if you make something reasonable and fair maybe the usage of phone doing school hours will stop.,Rebuttal
but with a few simple rules you can keep that the cell phone trouble from happening at all. ,Rebuttal
but these are not hard to deal with at all. ,Rebuttal
"But that doesn't mean I don't think students should have cell phones at school at all, but only on their free times.",Rebuttal
But i doubt it will be a problem since teenagers love there cell phones and do not want them taken away.,Rebuttal
But they would be making explanation to have their phones ,Rebuttal
"The school does have a phone, doesn't it? Why not use those instead. ",Rebuttal
"Otherwise, It is a good idea. What if something were to happen to that particular student? What if it was a personal problem and they could not come to a teacher? ",Rebuttal
but it is not on purpose ,Rebuttal
 That could easily be solved with simple punishments ,Rebuttal
"but we just have to really enforce that they can not be on in class, and there will not be a problem ",Rebuttal
"but there would be with the other one as well.
",Rebuttal
but if they are caught they should be punished. They should have their phones taken away for certain amounts of time.,Rebuttal
"but this should not happen if consequences are being reinforced.
",Rebuttal
I would start texting almost every hour I had free time on my hands. Other students who would have homework wouldn't do it because they can use their cell phone.,Rebuttal
With this policy it would allow the students to be able to socialize without doing it in class and disturbing others ,Rebuttal
That's why after lunch and free times you should do a cell phone check to see if the students turn off their phones ,Rebuttal
"but I hope that you will trust us, your students, enough to let us have our cell phones.",Rebuttal
Just leave your phone at home and you can get it when you are going home. I understand if you are in sports and you have to stay after school or you have no ride home that day.,Rebuttal
but I think we should still have our cell phones with us. ,Rebuttal
but discipline could take care of those problems,Rebuttal
 most of the time the teachers catch them. Many studenst would accept having their phones off during ,Rebuttal
But that may help kids if we were allowed cell phones during advisory to.,Rebuttal
"That they could talk to friends that across the school or to another school. This could a chance for them to hang out with a friend that they cant see during the school day.
",Rebuttal
"I think this happens because the students are not allowed to have cell phones during times that they are not in class so they find their own way to use them.
",Rebuttal
and that is not necessarily fair. We are a new generation and old sayings such as that one might be ready for an upgrade ,Rebuttal
These things are not very big things to worry about,Rebuttal
that doesn't mean that this will happen to everyone ,Rebuttal
Phones should be on during class so the student could use it during an emergency.,Rebuttal
but there are some reasons that students might need a cell phone at school.,Rebuttal
But just think about the amount of students that will be able to pay attention in class because they won't need to use their phone.,Rebuttal
"but that could be good way of communication to help out, to be in touch with your study group.",Rebuttal
" The only reason they should be used is for calculators and during free time, music if you have music on it.
",Rebuttal
but the problem would be that some students would not just turn their phones off when entering class because some of them don't really follow the rules as you know ,Rebuttal
" but when students aren't learning anything, they should have access to their phones. ",Rebuttal
but it is not right to take that privilege away from everyone.,Rebuttal
but if you don't let people use there phones they most likely still are going to use them.,Rebuttal
"Actually, the better scenario would be going to the office and calling from their phone. It is not that difficult ",Rebuttal
"However, I have made a plan to prevent this. ",Rebuttal
but teachers can check their cell phones after free times. ,Rebuttal
though there is a solution to that also.,Rebuttal
"Then, the unthinkable! He say's ""No."" Now you're in of class, teacher asks to see your homework. You reply. ""I left it at home."" and you get slapped with a detention! ",Rebuttal
then they could take that away for a week or two and see if they would start to follow the rules for the use of the phones ,Rebuttal
 I think if you have it on silent and you don't mess with it in class unless it is and absolute emergency then it is fine.,Rebuttal
but us as a nation we can do something about it or even change the education.,Rebuttal
"Well here are some ways to make sure the phones are turned off during class. One thing you can do is have all student, when they walk into class drop their phones into a little box. Another thing you can do is have the teachers check the phones and make sure that their turned off.",Rebuttal
"Then again with the students who follow the rules, there are the students who have nothing better to do but break, disobey, defy the school policies just because they wither want to show off that they can do it, are arrogant and think that they can do whatever they want, or rebelling in some cases. or just want to tick off the teacher for laughs and giggles. ",Rebuttal
"but it is not as good a trade, cell phones, and better grades.
",Rebuttal
 If they where aloud like in policy 1 then students wouldn't try as much to sneak them in because they know that they'll be able to use/check them at some point in the day. ,Rebuttal
"If there was an emergency, isn't that what the school phone in the office is for? If students really needed to call someone, they can simply get a pass and go down to the office to use their phone.",Rebuttal
phones such as iphones today are common to mostly all people. People should be allowed to use there phone for school work. Such as researching something for social studies. ,Rebuttal
 then I'm sure your school has a phone that you can use. ,Rebuttal
"Although there are negative and positives, i still would have to go with policy one.
",Rebuttal
The whole school shouldn't suffer from not having there phones because one person messed up.,Rebuttal
but I think that we should have a limit to how much use we get out of them.,Rebuttal
but i think we can do without some of it.,Rebuttal
then they could borrow one of their friend's phones and be able to contact their parent(s) or guardian(s).,Rebuttal
Some students choose to put their education before other things. ,Rebuttal
 I am a student who would consult with their teacher to use my phone at a certain time or free time,Rebuttal
but that's not how all students feel. The majority of students in present time choose to use their phone anytime in school during a class. ,Rebuttal
but i think if you let kids have their phones while they are not in class that be a reward to them. You could also say that any students caught with their phone inside the class room will get and automatic detention and their phone will be taken away. I think that would solve the problem. ,Rebuttal
"Kids may also still use their phones during class, even though it's not allowed. Sometimes people do things, just because they are against the rules. This rule would be that could be easily broken",Rebuttal
It would be better to have them at use in school because than students that want to learn can and the students that don't want to learn repeat the same classes until they pay attention enough to pass there class. ,Rebuttal
yet i do believe that the kids in the school would not do anything to jeopardise this ability. ,Rebuttal
"I suggest you don't do that because then the kids will bring them anyways and get in trouble more and that would be a bad thing in your case. Whatever you decide the kids will have to listen, but my decision would be to let us kids text and get it done with before we go to class. The students would appreciate you trying to understand their wants even more than you have to and you would have the possibility to be loved forever in these halls. ",Rebuttal
but i think the kids would just get mad and not do their work or something like that and basically go on strike against the school or teachers. ,Rebuttal
then the teacher should take them.,Rebuttal
 but it is worth a shot. ,Rebuttal
"if they do then they will have to go through consequences such as taking their phone away and not getting it back until either the end of the day, end of class, or a parent or guardian picks it up at the end of the day.",Rebuttal
Even though that is a good way for students to make calls to their parents they may not know the phone number by memory and they will not have their phone to look it up under the contacts.,Rebuttal
"But If you have the same class with your buddy, you don't need to pop out your cell phone just to get the buzz on who's dating who. In other words, cant you talk to your friends at lunch time?",Rebuttal
but there can be a consequence if they are using their cell phone during class.,Rebuttal
But teachers get to bring there cell phones to school and use them anytime they want so why shouldn't students?,Rebuttal
"but if is in lunch or free time I don't see much problem, because you are not being rude, or interrupting anyone. So I think that sometimes phones are useful at school.
",Rebuttal
instead they decide to bring DRAMA to the schools.,Rebuttal
" during lunch and off periods, there is no learning environment to disturb.",Rebuttal
But the teacher could have a basket for test days that the student would have to put their cell phones in ,Rebuttal
But adults don't understands things have change a lot since they were kids. When most adults were kids they didn't even know what a cell phones was. ,Rebuttal
I really dint understand why really before i got my cell phone is 6th grade I didn't rat on anyone come on guys really just wait a few years and u will be having fun like the rest of us and you wouldn't want to be in trouble because of some kids that don't have one would? Think about it. ,Rebuttal
"but some students may need their cell phones after school if there in sports or in any kind of activity, they may not even have to be in a sport at all. ",Rebuttal
but there's always a punishment for that. ,Rebuttal
But some may just have a smart phone and may just play games and not even interrupt other people. Yea what if kids don't have a smart phone? That doesn't mean they cant have one at school.,Rebuttal
but there is a always a consequence for that persons actions. Some students may get caught and some may not but when they do the teacher or teachers should have all the power to look at the students history on their phone to see if they have been messaging other students in other class.,Rebuttal
nut still in there free time they should be able to do what they want well in reason anyway ,Rebuttal
but there are also a lot of useful places for a phone in a school day.,Rebuttal
you might not know what will happen.,Rebuttal
who would take the risk to text them back or call them back?,Rebuttal
But to really make the student do their best is to give them a break or free time to show you really care.,Rebuttal
That's no excuse for taking out your phone. There are at least 100 phones in the school - use those for your communication or reminding purposes.,Rebuttal
"But I'm positive this won't happen if you make this a school policy.
",Rebuttal
"The thing is, what if students weren't using them during class and couldn't bring them anymore.",Rebuttal
"but it might be because they forgot something at home like for example there homework or gym clothes. Even if you try to ban cell phones students won't obey and they will bring them anyway, unless you confiscate it.",Rebuttal
"Well here is the solution, right before class everyone takes out there phones and turns them off. Then they will give them to there teacher and she will put them in a box on her desk.",Rebuttal
"but if you had us keep them in our lockers until our free period, you wouldn't have to worry. ",Rebuttal
"When my friends tell me the teacher took their phone, I tell them you shouldn't have took it out. It not the teacher fault she had to take the phone, she was just following the rules, it the students fault. If the student don't like the rules, they should do something about it, like a petition",Rebuttal
but if the student is careful enough they can keep there phone safe. ,Rebuttal
 but I really think its very reasonable for us to be able to use our cell phones because the important reasons are more likely than the negative reasons.,Rebuttal
but I know teenagers always find ways around rules and abuse them. I know the faculty doesn't want to waste their time cleaning up the mess that phones would leave. ,Rebuttal
 If cell phones were allowed at school they would not be ringing during class because students would turn their cell phones off or put them on silent or vibrate mode.,Rebuttal
but if children have the privlege to do more things and be trusted they could most likely act more mature.,Rebuttal
"but once students get used to the idea that they are allowed to use their phones during free time only, they won't bother with sneaking any texts during class.",Rebuttal
but not as good as Policy 1 ,Rebuttal
but they won't notice the other students as much.,Rebuttal
but in my opinion i think the more positive points that i have listed above outweigh the negative ones ,Rebuttal
"The others are in the hallway, outside, or in a place where their phones won't disturb anyone around them. That is a big positive.",Rebuttal
"However, I don't think that this would be a huge problem. After a week or two, you could stop giving students the benefit of the doubt, and start enforcing the punishments. ",Rebuttal
Wrong what if the power goes off and the front office phones are down. then what.,Rebuttal
and you know what they might and if so just band cell phones for like a week or so and if they bring it within that week and if they get caught just take up there phone.,Rebuttal
so i thing there should be cameras in all classroom.,Rebuttal
that's why a teacher is there for stopping them from using it.,Rebuttal
"will a teacher has a right to take it up. but returning it after class , because some teachers in campus are going threw students privacy.

and that is not good.",Rebuttal
"If you don't the students will have a distraction in their pocket or purse all through the day. If that happens, then the students will become distracted in some of their other classes, and that will horribly impact their grades.",Rebuttal
That is not true. I have just given you an example of a straight A student. ,Rebuttal
but kids ruin the advantage that they get for being able to have their cell phones out. ,Rebuttal
 this would not stop them from using them. ,Rebuttal
but if they do teachers can just get them into trouble and they wont do that anymore. If they will then that's when you don't let them bring it to school at all. ,Rebuttal
"but, if they are allowed at schools then students should have no reason to do it in class when they know they can do it at a free time in the day.",Rebuttal
"But that is why there is suspension and discipline for that sort of thing. There are rebels out there, and whether you ban phones or not, they will most likely continue to have them in their possession. ",Rebuttal
"Although these are good reasons, I think that it is a lot more difficult for a student to go up to a teacher and ask them to use the phone than to just call their parents on their own phone. ",Rebuttal
"So would you rather have your students going behind your back and bringing there phones to school and text all threw school, or let them bring them to school and they only text during lunch",Rebuttal
"but, they can be turned on because what if there is an emergency and they don't have the time to turn there phone on ",Rebuttal
but I just think it would be to much of a distraction.,Rebuttal
you can take their phone away as a warning. ,Rebuttal
Since these are risks that must be taken into account. I propose a compromise between the two extremes.,Rebuttal
"Although, uncomfortability is what strengthens the minds of students. ",Rebuttal
"However,

in adulthood,

approaching new atmospheres is something done daily; the ability to adapt to them isn't built through a screen or over a phone. ",Rebuttal
"Yet, apprehension of the idea and experience with it is necessary for the abundance of situations one will encounter. ",Rebuttal
although it provides complications for those who support their participation. ,Rebuttal
"Consequently, this allows those who participate in after-school related activites to be scouted out easier instead of those who are doing non-school sanctioned events. ",Rebuttal
"However, it is not helpful for the future applications of the skills that can be learned from attending class phsically. ",Rebuttal
 this is not necessarily true. In-class education gives students a glimpse into the reality of work; it allows students to learn and work in conditions that they will likely be in in the future. ,Rebuttal
Th epoint may have some merit but the benefits outweigh the douwnsides ,Rebuttal
"The solution to this long going problem ,of taking physical classes with crowded class rooms and many distractions, is to let their children take online courses.",Rebuttal
"However, my question is ""Do these outlets reach out and succeeded to out way the bullying and stress of a normal public school?""

because the answer is ""No."". ",Rebuttal
learning in a classroom is still better.,Rebuttal
" but essentially the fatigue students have would be gone and they would be able to participate, understand, and comprehend the information they're learning. ",Rebuttal
"but a lot of students would benefit from this alternative and their performance would improve if schools offer online classes that could be attended from home, for some of their subjects.",Rebuttal
"All of these are understandable, but they are not without solution.",Rebuttal
that is why a student's parent could supervise the student on each test and let the teacher know that the student was honest. This would be an easy way of reassurance for all instructors. ,Rebuttal
"Teachers and educators would say those are the students the assignments are made for in the first place, but it is not fair to the students who do the work if the majority does not. ",Rebuttal
 actually students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home ,Rebuttal
"but they should be able to just seek extra help. Still going into school part of their time. Resonsilbilty is one of the most important things that one has in their day to day lives, but being taugh it earlier in life can help people master it for the rest of their lives. ",Rebuttal
"To those students, if they chose to do that, they would have to go into a school building and spend more time with the classes they did not do anything with. They would have some freedom taken away, so that they know what they are missing out on. ",Rebuttal
"but, that is their oppinion.",Rebuttal
"I think most parents would prefer their kids going to school, and being in a classroom so they can understand the lesson, know how to do it, and know what the teacher is talking about. Going to school at home can not help you pass the grade, go to the next grade, or graduate from high school, because at home you are not learning anything.
",Rebuttal
but one should take in consideration that students do have the ability to prioritize things that are important to them. ,Rebuttal
but this statement is completely false.,Rebuttal
those who do work may receive a higher salary since there are less teachers than before. ,Rebuttal
does not mean students should not take a leap of faith and give distance learning a try due to all the benefits. ,Rebuttal
The way students who are taking classes at school it will never become similar to the students who arevtaking classes at home.,Rebuttal
"a student could get rid of distractions at home, and they might not be able to do anything about internet while traveling they can still get some stuff done while they are away. ",Rebuttal
"But, Kids need social interaction. Social Interaction is a vital part of development. If students have school over the computer or video chatting, they are not getting the proper interaction they need.",Rebuttal
They could focus on learning because of their grades,Rebuttal
 Overall being able to work from home is more beneficial for students. ,Rebuttal
 Many students feel that you don't need to know a lot of people to be happy ,Rebuttal
Many students could say that if you do get home sick you could you just go to your backyard and just sit their and enjoy the sun for a little while,Rebuttal
but when you really put thought into it you would have time to do them both.,Rebuttal
"Even though teachers may become a little overwhelmed at the beginning of teaching both online and at school classes, they will soon get in the groove of how things will go.",Rebuttal
" However, the students who do their schooling online are in a better and comfortable learning environment. Therefore, making it easier to learn and complete the necessary assignments vital to their subjects.
",Rebuttal
"However, the knowledge a attending classes from home student has is the same as a attending school student.",Rebuttal
"However, being alone all the time and only seeing the same few family members day to day without any change can be very taxing to people and we need that change of scenery sometimes. ",Rebuttal
"However, There are more things to distract you and less people around to help you when you need it and to actually keep you focused. ",Rebuttal
" However, It costs money to travel to these places, either by public transportation or from money for gas, and still many of those public spaces require a fee to use their devices. ",Rebuttal
"But, immersing them in an environment that encourages social interaction would be a more ideal situation as they would be able to learn how to overcome their anxiety; there are more effective, and less drastic measures that can be taken to help a student with social anxiety as opposed to taking them out of the classroom setting altogether and replacing them with online settings.
",Rebuttal
"Nonetheless, this peace of mind is only applicable if the student is mentally and/or physically capable to do schoolwork while enduring such a taxing hardship. Online classes may come in handy when students would usually miss school, even the pros are of this school system are laced with cons.
",Rebuttal
"While this is valid, it's still very stressful to have to do something you don't want to do or aren't comfortable with.",Rebuttal
As long as the teen can be in a closed environment with less distractions it should not be that big of a problem ,Rebuttal
but it would more or less show when taking a test without knowing the required knowledge that they just took off of the internet,Rebuttal
But that I believe just depends on the situation the person is in. ,Rebuttal
But with the video conferencing the teacher can redirect the student or by using a grading system if they do all their work on time. ,Rebuttal
"but that will be stopped because students will need to learn the subject because they will take a test and if they don't pass the test, they will not receive the credits of that class.",Rebuttal
"But, this can become too much of a luxury or privilege for students who don't have proficient time-management skills.",Rebuttal
its really not beneficial for many students.,Rebuttal
it's more for students who are antisocial or just problems and prefer to be homeschooled.,Rebuttal
"Due to today's modern technical advancements, a student could benefit more in school, if learning new subjects were offered on a computer screen, in the comfort of their own home ",Rebuttal
"This is not true though, teachers and schools could place a grade on attendance to encourage students to show up for classes. ",Rebuttal
"Although that might be the case for some, majority of students actually do well with online school due to down time. ",Rebuttal
it is not hard to make up assignments nor to get them in advance.,Rebuttal
"While this can be true, many students have anxiety or can become nervous when talking to teachers.",Rebuttal
"Although these are great facts, it all depends on what would be better for your own education.
",Rebuttal
it is much better than finding transportation.,Rebuttal
but at least everything else is free online.,Rebuttal
distance learning is a more efficient way to provide help for students to understand better.,Rebuttal
"While this may be true, we are in a society that is changing rapidly, and we need to benefit ourselves in the greatest possibility.",Rebuttal
"Therefore, to continue to back up my argument and/or point of view studies have even shown the major in increase of the at home learning rate increaing another 50% in the United States simply because students and/or scholars feel their at there best when their in a familiar setting open and ready to learn ",Rebuttal
their reasoning is flawed due to the fact that it is always easier to make new relationships through face to face physical contact.,Rebuttal
" however buy in large the hands on part is extremely important due to the fact that everyone learns differently whether it be auditory, visual, or hands on. ",Rebuttal
"While I get where they are coming from, their reasoning is still wrong",Rebuttal
" In situations like these, the school should help provide the student with the appropriate equipment and better their education. ",Rebuttal
but there is other ways to prove your knowledge. In school you take tests to prove mastery of the skill or topic you've just learned ,Rebuttal
"I disagree because it much easier to learn when you are put under the intense stress of having to keep up with everything or being put on a strict hour and a half time-line. Not only that, but sitting in a hard chair all day without being able to really move or socialize can make it much harder to concentrate. ",Rebuttal
"While cyberbullying could still take place while a student is distance learning, there are others measures that can be taken to stop this from happening.",Rebuttal
" I think that if the student has a strong support system and has thought very hard about making the transfer from traditional education to distance education, they will be motivated enough to complete their schoolwork on time. ",Rebuttal
" there are some situations that can go wrong. The student could have technical difficulties, if the website cannot load or if on a conference call, there could be trouble with the connection and not working. ",Rebuttal
"the school system could still finance those who truly need support, and it would still be a much lower cost than facillitating an entire school building. ",Rebuttal
"However this is not true, because the new technology allows for conference calls between students and teachers that can afford them the opportunity to ask questions and receieve answers in a timely fashion.",Rebuttal
but this is not true.,Rebuttal
"Overall, the amount of disadvantages to taking classes at home overrule the amount of benefits that there are.",Rebuttal
"however i believe that they would benefit because a lot of those students who take classes from home by the way of online, ends up finishing their studies, and their wouldn't be any difference from the one who made it in school. Having friends and fun is good but ain't the priority , the priority is to get what's important and what will help in the future.
",Rebuttal
"However, online classes would not be easy for everyone. For students without financial support, they might not be able to attend school online, even if they wanted to. Laptops and computers are very expensive, and to buy them the student will need a copious amount of money. ",Rebuttal
"However, there are many students who are too anxious, introverted, or unmotivated to engage in other activities.",Rebuttal
"however, I believe that if you do take online classes it will do the same as if you went to school because it will be the same material and it will be a less of a hassel waking up every morning to go to school.",Rebuttal
doing so may hurt their behaviors in secretive ways. ,Rebuttal
"However, a child has numerous opportunities to get involved in activities outside home to create friendships and bonds ",Rebuttal
 Attend classes from home by way online help this type of case the students go to work few hours and then coming home for the rest of the day to study or another option is one day work and the next day don't and stay at home taking the online classes ,Rebuttal
 but sometimes is really important to going schools beacuse when we going schools we have more chance to take more clases and graduated with the other student.,Rebuttal
it should be known that that online or video conferencing do benefit students.,Rebuttal
thats how they will pass classes better at school then online . ,Rebuttal
"Although this aspect of education may not be as important as people may say, there is definitely a correlation between how strong the connection between the student and the teacher to how well the student receives and understands the information that they are given ",Rebuttal
but all in all they are really only stress free because no pressure is being put on them to complete tasking and test by a certain time.,Rebuttal
"A rebuttal to this would be that while that is true, an online class will prepare students for college.",Rebuttal
"however whent the student take this classes from home he are more distractic because he have the cellphone in his hand or he have the TV in the room, the dog, the play station and he going to prefer play or see movies than work on the classes.
",Rebuttal
"but by requiring students to attend a class somewhere else, many students sacrifice eating, in order to arrive to class on time, yet online classes can help students enjoy the benefits of breakfast. Online classes make students lives more flexible and versatile by allowing them to decide when to take the class. ",Rebuttal
"online school doesn't remove the teacher, it only allows for another option, which is always a positive. If students still want to go to class, they still can. ",Rebuttal
 but there is still a factor missing. The factor missing with virtual classes is the physical human interaction ,Rebuttal
"thus, it is beneficial take classes online becuase you don't have to pay money to the school for uniforms and, all the required things that they ask you to buy. When you can save the money,it can be use to pay the classes online.",Rebuttal
"But, in turn, this could make the school year shorter, and give the kids a longer break for summer. ",Rebuttal
" But most of the time, Students will still show up to classes, and it may be easier this way to avoid embarrassment if they have anxiety or another type of disorder like I do. ",Rebuttal
"however, this development should not come at the cost of students' ability to comprehend their lessons. ",Rebuttal
there is not enough help at home for the students to do the work by themselves ,Rebuttal
"But it being at its early stages means that it is evidently going to have problems; although, if we were continue to iron out these problems it would be another tool/resource for students to use.",Rebuttal
"we are far too advanced not to use it. Advancements in technology would significantly help students who want a more personalized learning experience, and prefer to do their work in a quieter area.
",Rebuttal
"These are major problems with online classes but they don't outweigh the benefits because many people are successful when enrolled and continue to take them.
",Rebuttal
"but it's better for them to stay focused on what they are doing,",Rebuttal
 but there are too many setbacks that would make it more inefficient than what school is in its current state of public teaching. People like to be in a setting where they are able to ask questions if needed and get help in an instant. The majority of students benefit from learning in person and that makes a really big difference ,Rebuttal
Distance learning is meant for students who are serious about their education. ,Rebuttal
" This is understandable, but schools are only offering this opportunity to students who wish to explore this opportunity of learning and are not forcing it upon anyone.",Rebuttal
"This is due to the fact of who teaches the class, what class it is, and the school itself. Always make sure you double check the teacher, the class, and the school itself to see if it is flexible enough for you to attend it without feeling too confined or inflexible. ",Rebuttal
online classes can help those who tend to be more shy than others are. ,Rebuttal
Many student feel that high school isnt for them or thats in a waste a time but imagine where youd be without high school.,Rebuttal
This attitude has been around forever but in fact most teens that are home schooled or take a large portion of classes online are found to be socially impaired later in life. Everyone deserves to have an equal opportunity and to not be held back because other their social awkwardness. ,Rebuttal
"I disagree with this because I think modern problems require modern solutions. With today's technology, everything is possible online, a solution to students not having someone to lecture them could be an online video conference with the teacher that is also at home, allowing the students to ask questions and interact directly with the teacher. ",Rebuttal
"That is not true because most of us are adults and responsible, and for those who have a history of being irresponsible, should be monitored by their parents at home to make sure they are working and doing their dues.",Rebuttal
"but it can actually help you on later in life.
",Rebuttal
"However people that are home schooled on spend 2-3 hours doing online work and the rest of the day is theirs, but get the same amount of learning a regular student gets in 8 hours and have no time left after school ",Rebuttal
but students do it all the time in public school anyways.,Rebuttal
"However, students already have to focus at home for homework. By having kids focus on a class at home, it would actually help reinforce their ability to focus and be disciplined in an environment in which they could be easily distracted, which is a useful life skill. Overall, in the more relaxed environment of home, students could be much more productive and successful in their classes than if they attended in person. ",Rebuttal
"However, the time saved through online classes would actually allow students to spend more time out with friends, which would teach them to get along with other people well.",Rebuttal
Attending classes in school will teach students important lessons on what to do in these cases. They make students aware of bullying that can either happen in school or online and give them lessons on what to do and seek help. With classes at home kids will not know what to do and stay quiet thinking that there is no way out of a bullying situation.,Rebuttal
"A possible solution to this is a message board between the students and teacher so one or more of the students has a question the students can get the answer they need. The students could also help their classmates through the message board and FaceTime, if one of the students has a question and the teacher can't be contacted. ",Rebuttal
however being home provides a more relaxing tone to studying then when you are at school.,Rebuttal
the lesson can still be recovered and reviewed again by uploading the video again and watching it through. So there should be no excuses for missing out on lessons.,Rebuttal
it will overall yield better results than learning in the classroom.,Rebuttal
"however, students need to learn in an environment outside their home. In reality, when they go out and get jobs or pursue their goals, these experiences and skills are needed to be professional and have a successfully performances.",Rebuttal
but most times that is not enough.,Rebuttal
"but then again, very few offer that type of compassion. ",Rebuttal
"however, they need to realize without giving them a chance they wouldn't know what would be the result. ",Rebuttal
but what about in the future when they lack basic social skills? ,Rebuttal
not all. Even if online school is more personalized that would leave the student with a very self involved attitude that would not bode well for them in their future lives. ,Rebuttal
"however, I would argue that practicing to wake up on time for school is a valuable life skill that will most certainly benefit students in their future lives.",Rebuttal
but it would be more difficult for them as the programs are based on school activities and organized around the school schedule.,Rebuttal
"Consequently, the new technology that made online school an option also created a new type of bullying, cyberbullying. Even attending school online cannot prevent one from being cyberbullied as it is through the very technology the use for their education.",Rebuttal
"while it might be true, we can see how students can be affected by observing them. Furthermore, certain environments give prime examples of how comfort affects the way students receive knowledge.
",Rebuttal
Others have the belief that giving the choice to students on how they want to learn is an amazing idea because it allows them to have a say in how they want to go about their education. ,Rebuttal
here are plenty of examples of people who work at home and have made successful careers from being at home ,Rebuttal
"yet this is not the reason for attending school, for it is to learn and prepare for college, adult life, and work.
",Rebuttal
"people with mental disabilities will almost always attend some kind of specialized learning in school, which even then has flaws from being in school.",Rebuttal
 actually some people say students will be benefit to attend classes from home because it will save students time and it will develop students confidence on technology. ,Rebuttal
"students would benefits from being able to attend class from home for this issue, students not leaning in one video conference but, some students don't want to go to the school because they have more than 17 years old or they can't enter to school for their age. Because, for you can enter to school minimal you need to have 15 to 17. Also, you have 18 you can't not to enter at school and is a problem because you can't find a good work if you dont have a graduation certificate from school.",Rebuttal
"this claim is unsupported as several important social skills are developed at a very young age, according to several studies regarding brain connections. Through distance learning, a student is unexposed to opportunities for developing integral social skills, which are necessary for his or her success in the future. ",Rebuttal
"However, distant learning has more benefits for students. ",Rebuttal
But it stems from the belief that a student's reasoning behind it are unacceptable ,Rebuttal
when it's not,Rebuttal
but it's still better going to school and learning ,Rebuttal
but some students may go to their room and work or say their working when they're really not.,Rebuttal
others can't.,Rebuttal
"but this holds little benefit to them. In short, distance learning would set up an introverted student for failure in life.",Rebuttal
" While home-schooling would eliminate the fear of social anxiety, I believe that it is better to face it and get used to it, rather than hide from it. ",Rebuttal
"There's no denying that ecological improvement remote courses would cause; however, the more comfortable students feel at home, they will be equally more distracted ",Rebuttal
 but this could be very beneficial for the others who physically can't come to school or who can't learn in the schooling environment without getting punished.,Rebuttal
"However, with online school that could be streaming across the country, technology is subject to glitches and shutdowns. In addition, video chatting prevents the teacher from truly showing the student how to perform a task,",Rebuttal
"However, attending a physical school and using computers as an aid to learning rather than a form of learning itself is the best option to prepare students for a digital world, as it will give them proper skills and tools to succeed along their learning journey.",Rebuttal
"Although that could be a possibility, studies show that when you give someone many limitations and rules, they tend to break the rules more than the usual.",Rebuttal
but school isn't the only place or way to develop social skills ,Rebuttal
"but when you're working far too slow because you continue to ""take breaks,"" whether to deal with distractions out of your control or to procrastinate the entire day, it's no longer beneficial and you aren't making any real progress like you would in a classroom with little to steal your attention.
",Rebuttal
but they are wrong because it does not teach them what the real world is going to be like ,Rebuttal
" I agree that there are likely to be several students that would not make efficient use of the online learning system, which is why it should not be employed for every student that asks for it. Rather, distance learning should be used for the students who need it.",Rebuttal
"but the in-person teachings are crucial for kids to develop and grow.
",Rebuttal
"but knowing you have to get something done right after you start is not fun and specially if you not getting the help you need not being able to ask the questions you have makes it a lot harder, ",Rebuttal
"They are wrong, because life is not just to focus on what you want to do when you finish school, is to enjoy it and do whatever they want to do in their life. Some people want the best for their kids, but life is one and they should enjoy it.",Rebuttal
"While understandable, that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that students who have these problems choose homeschooling as an alternative ",Rebuttal
but they are wrong.,Rebuttal
but it is possible to graduate without taking any college level classes.,Rebuttal
but that's wrong.,Rebuttal
"This would not be a big effect of online learning however, kids who are in school typically skip classes and walk around or don't pay attention. No matter what they will be kids who won't learn and try but online learning would not add to this factor ",Rebuttal
However online programs aren't what they seem to be sometimes you might see the positive in things but with the positive comes the negative. ,Rebuttal
" however, having class at ones fingertips can be very beneficial.",Rebuttal
"We should be well aware of the financial problem of this idea and maybe in time someone can find a way to make this method more accessible to the masses
",Rebuttal
"But offering distance learning can cause students to do bad on their test,quizes,and homework because they'll need help throughout the assignments,multiple students may not have anyone to help them at home. Teachers may have a hard time video conferencing multiple students at the same time. Students might take advantages of online learning and start cheating at home while the teachers won't know. ",Rebuttal
"There is no doubt that doing online school is much more beneficial then public school.
",Rebuttal
" this is still true for distance learning, and with common sense, the side effects of it can be determined quite easily. ",Rebuttal
But as I said in the first paragraph I would've thought of it different then any other scholar/students. ,Rebuttal
but many of the greatest epidemics of the twenty-first century have been due to the proliferation of disease by child and adolescent carriers.,Rebuttal
"but is rather amplified by the lack of distractions from events in a regular classroom or other students, allowing for an equal distribution and ratio of teacher attention to student performance rather than behavior or minimizing distraction. Grades will go up, costs will go down, and teachers and students can mutually gain from one another. ",Rebuttal
Attending online class might be good for some reasons ,Rebuttal
"However, offering distance learning would allow people who cannot go to school learn, which would increase the worlds educated.",Rebuttal
"While performing this function does seem to advantage traditional schools, it is not necessarily a bad thing for distance schooling. In fact, students are quite often put in social situations outside of a school setting.",Rebuttal
"there is an easy solution to this. If online learning is proposed in schools, students should be able to request video conferences with their teachers if they require additional instruction. If classes are held live online with all of the students instead of done at the students pace, the students could ""raise their hand"" by clicking something on their screen that makes something pop up on the teacher's screen, and the teacher would then call on them. ",Rebuttal
but they choose what time they would like to take it and what days ,Rebuttal
"On the other hand, online school would benefit the students by not being tired in class and they can learn at there own paste. ",Rebuttal
regular high school have different program to help students to be successful on their grades. ,Rebuttal
others may find that these courses significantly lower their academic performance. ,Rebuttal
"On the other hand, students would find themselves staying in their homes for much longer than is recommended, negatively affecting physical and mental health.",Rebuttal
"This is just the most ridiculous argument, because since when has keeping the same policies effective",Rebuttal
"While, students would not be in a classroom with others, this is still not a persuasive point ",Rebuttal
"Having social life it's really important but who said that being in home school means that they are not going to have any social life, it's the opposite because if students are all caught up with their things they are going to have so much time to hang out with friends and family.
",Rebuttal
These students manage to have a lot of free time because they're able to achieve more things in a shorter amount of time. This is due to the fact that people achieve things faster without distractions. Online classes offer more free time when students finish the required assignments quicker than in a classroom.,Rebuttal
"but studies show that when surrounded by all of their friends a majority of students tend to get less work done. If a student were to switch to online classes at home, this would not occur.",Rebuttal
"While this may be true, not all students are like this, and if they abuse the system it will ultimately harm them.",Rebuttal
"Most of online classes contains teacher's email or there is a way to send a massage and ask questions relating to the lesson. Sometimes, there are group chats for students to attending the same online class to communicate and discus the lesson. But however, communication between students are not necessary or a way for students to learn more about the lesson.",Rebuttal
but it is good for some students who want to study.,Rebuttal
Nevertheless their are other ideas ,Rebuttal
students would feel less obligated to leave their house since extracurricular activities involve social interactions which students would have no practice in.,Rebuttal
there would be nothing stopping a teen from playing video games in the background during an important lecture ,Rebuttal
"That may be true in some ways, but that is such a smaller percentage of people wanting be home schooled than those who dont ",Rebuttal
But the level of distractions at home are much higher than at public schools and thats while not trying to work ,Rebuttal
"But honesty there are so many more positives to public schooling, its hard to really make a argument between the two. ",Rebuttal
many pupils would benefit from online or video conferencing.,Rebuttal
"However, not all students do well in a traditional classroom and prefer to learn at home. Distractions, drama, poor time management, and and mental health issues that can be found or developed in the classroom can prevent certain students from having a successful high school experience ",Rebuttal
"However most kids hate to do work, their all about sticking it to the man.",Rebuttal
This can be solved by having a certain amount of time needed spent on a slide/assignment before turning it in. Online teachers will be able to monitor how long students have spent on something and if they don't meet the requirements they can test them. ,Rebuttal
it can actually be beneficial in preventing them from falling behind and by it being easily adjusted into diverse lifestyles.,Rebuttal
Teens however tend to have very bad anxiety when it comes to going to a school with a bunch of other students.,Rebuttal
"I honestly feel much better doing work at home then being school, if you need help or anything just email the teacher.",Rebuttal
"but in reality, students would get the same amount of learning but in a different environment, an environment they are used to since it is their home ",Rebuttal
"But that does not apply to everyone, everyone is not in bad influence and if you are good yourself you would not let anyone lead you to the wrong way ",Rebuttal
"but if a student actually wants to learn and is dedicated to it. Then they will succeed no matter where they're taking their classes. Taking classes at home isn't that much different than being home schooled.
",Rebuttal
"Online school doesn't really allow students to collaborate with each other, but there are many student's who learn better that way. Also, if a student is to miss school, at least they have the online class to refer to, instead of just falling behind.
",Rebuttal
" In this situation they need someone to guid them through the online course, or they can take a home tutour.
",Rebuttal
it does not replicate the same level of understanding that a student might gain if they were able to speak directly to their teacher.,Rebuttal
but it causes problems in the long run ,Rebuttal
but these things can still be achieved in an online setting.,Rebuttal
Distance learning offers the student to have more free time throughout the day due to shorter classes and not having the immense amount of wasted time that traditional public/private schools have ,Rebuttal
But it is more important to come to school because it benefits you gain more experience.,Rebuttal
"However, these online or video conferencing classes could lead the students to become lazy or less motivated to do anything.",Rebuttal
"Although that is true, it is important that students are able to put themselves in a position where they can secede",Rebuttal
"but, studies showed that a lot of students who got their education online had a hardtime adopting into the colleges.",Rebuttal
"Students taken classes online will be more smart, because there will more practice skills for the future where will be benefits of know how classes are doing online, and they where taking. ",Rebuttal
they are not for most. ,Rebuttal
but schools can issue them out and and put warranties on the computers to make sure they get them back allowing for acces to the school. ,Rebuttal
but there are ways to implement it in a way that significantly reduce the chances that it's taken advantage of. ,Rebuttal
"This however is not the case. Many students in the classroom, have stated that they wish that they could do more at home, so that if they miss school, they aren't rushing to get back on top ",Rebuttal
"The principal said "" For sure, we want as many students possible to attend school, but for some reasons not all them can make to school, and as a benefit and an opportunity for others to learn we decide to make this program"". The principal made many reunions with parents that disagree with this idea. After a month must of them accepted and understood the goal of the program. ",Rebuttal
"going to school knowing that there is tardiness, will prepare them for the future when running to work and making it on time. Making to school or work on time depends on how the individual is smart enough to manage their own time wisely. ",Rebuttal
This is simply not true. ,Rebuttal
but it is because if they have to work then can still do there school work,Rebuttal
but i world love to do my work at home were i dont have to be in class all day with people because i really dont like being i rooms with a lot if people in the class rooms ,Rebuttal
"Online school is just a situationally helpful way to stay and learn just on the person's own time. If a students parents and teachers know a kid would not be the right fit for online school, then it would not be recommended for that kid",Rebuttal
"Although it may seem like a bad idea, teachers requires students to show work and that clearly an easy option when it comes to cheating.",Rebuttal
it is not beneficial towards recieving an education in every aspect. ,Rebuttal
but wouldn't be beneficial toward recieving all the benefits of going to a school location and recieving your education there. ,Rebuttal
they are wrong. Learning in school is better for the students.,Rebuttal
"I think that in a learning environment that should not be the case. Learning is not about being able to complete an assignment in an hour, but it is about being able to understand new information.",Rebuttal
"To avoid instances like this, students should be able to learn at home where they can sit in a room all by themselves, free from any outside noises or distractions that may hinder their learning ",Rebuttal
it can be an important quality for other students to learn the importance of being responsible for their future.,Rebuttal
but there should not be bullies in your school in the first place ,Rebuttal
"These concerns are valid due to the importance of having social skills in life, but students can learn these skills through experience; for example, they can learn by going out with their friends or relatives. ",Rebuttal
but other cant learn like that,Rebuttal
"mental health is an issue many students may experience,",Rebuttal
"However, there are those who much rather take the class online instad of leaving their home.",Rebuttal
However that is true in all it does save everyone a lot more time in class to be learning new materials if they did give them that option,Rebuttal
"While understandable, that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that if students aren't challenged enough they won't be able to see what they can accomplish.",Rebuttal
" but the costs would outweigh the benefits.
",Rebuttal
 distance learning courses are beneficial for students whose family are on a budget because the affordability of online courses surpasses the attendance of a public school when accounting for all the additional taxes and fees that are put onto students who are attending a physical school. ,Rebuttal
"However, they don't think of all the things that are at home that could potentially be a big distractions for the students.",Rebuttal
"it would get the work done, but the student would not learn anything. ",Rebuttal
"In the other hand, they are people who also believe that taking classes in school is better. ",Rebuttal
"With a few solid points, this argument is somewhat invalid.",Rebuttal
This will not help them improve their social skills because to improve in anything there must be consistency. There is no other consistent place to go for a student than school. ,Rebuttal
"If these students were at school they could ask the teacher for extra help on the subject. Though most online courses have a final test that covers everything the student learned they can still cheat on that but, they wouldn't need to cheat if they learned it at school since they know the material. ",Rebuttal
but my parents dissagreed.,Rebuttal
"Well, if students take an online class then students won't have an opportunity to do chemical labs for Chemistry or a pig disection for Biology. By doing an experience or by doing any activity physically and visually makes the students learn and understnd better, which is hard for students who take an online class. ",Rebuttal
which is not a wrong or abnormal thing.,Rebuttal
Theres still students that would prefer being home and getting their work down at home then being in school dealing with drama or extra assignments. Theres students who would rather focus on online classes and finish them and also have a part time job on the side to help them pay for their colleges. ,Rebuttal
"but students going to school is not the cause of them misbehaving.
",Rebuttal
Even though this is true learning is still a different journey for every student.,Rebuttal
" that however, is flawed because many people have benefited from online classes not only in grades, but in mental health. ",Rebuttal
 online classes already have built in counter measures to mitigate those exact problems,Rebuttal
" this however is flawed due to the fact that many students prefer, and many more students end up passing online classes more than a conventional class ",Rebuttal
some are not yet capable of the responsibility that needs to be taken in order to complete courses from home.,Rebuttal
 but you have to realize that you're not going to understand the topic as much as you would understand when you're at school. ,Rebuttal
"Although, there are few cases where the online classes could trump classroom learning there is still too many cons out weighing the benefits from the program.
",Rebuttal
"but whenever one gets tired or needs to rest, they can simply stand up, walk around, and take a break for as long as necessary. Students can also take as long as they want on whatever lesson their learning. If, for example, a student does not understand a topic, they can ask for help from a professor, or play back the lesson again until they understand what they have missed. ",Rebuttal
"It has be said by a multitude of professors that taking a break from and hour of work and doing something for a little bit is helpful and can reduce the pressure of work, which in turn will make the students work better.",Rebuttal
The benefits greatly out way the the downsides ,Rebuttal
"However, this is not true because taking online classes isn't an attempt to isolate oneself, but is done because it is what's best for that person",Rebuttal
online learning can actually be more productive than at school.,Rebuttal
"While it is truly pitiable that they are simple enough to think that is the case, it could also be a kind of benefit. A way to weed out those students with a exceptionally poor work ethic. Their grades will drop, and they will realize that their lack of effort is the only thing to blame. And if they don't realize this, well, it's probably better that they will be held back and not introduced into society in their current state.
",Rebuttal
 but it costs more to do online than it does to do public ,Rebuttal
" but if the student has the chance to get a better grade on an assignment by cheating with no chance of getting caught, I believe the student will take that chance ",Rebuttal
"however, it doesn't benefit a student because what they can experience and learn is extremely limited.",Rebuttal
but also grants those who may be subject to bullying a safe space to learn.,Rebuttal
"I believe students will get the right balance of work and relaxation.
",Rebuttal
"but that is information we will likely never know, as they are not permitted the time necessary to explore their interests. Perhaps there are many students with innovative ideas for research projects that lack the time for it. With the addition of online school, students might be able to devote more time to discovering their interests and pursuing them.
",Rebuttal
"The purpose of school is for guiding students into being a greater mold of themselves. School helps you adapt to lifestyle. Without school, students will fail in life. ",Rebuttal
They are wrong because the students not learn to much and they would have bad grades.,Rebuttal
They are wrong because real teachers explain better than online class or videos conferencing. ,Rebuttal
"It is true that students are able to be more comfortable at home by having a choice in what they wear, where they sit, or when they take the classes, but this is often a negative factor. Being too comfortable can be distracting and it does not benefit the learning experience. The brain tells the body that it is at home and it can cause the mind to be less focused.",Rebuttal
"While there may not be other students there, there are pets, family, and objects that can be destructive to learning and attention. ",Rebuttal
"However, there is a balance to everything, many options, such as only taking two or three classes at home and the rest in school. Or taking at home classes with only a small amount of people. ",Rebuttal
"While thinking that way is reasonable, it is inaccurate because teens will always go through hardships and they will need to overcome that hardships. ",Rebuttal
"Others may argue that students would not benefit from attending classes at home. But it all depends on how a person learns. However if a person learns better with people around, or if a person learns better without people around them. ",Rebuttal
But have try to really socialize with someone face to face. Most of kids now are own phone or computers talking to people online but not face to face. ,Rebuttal
"If there is no one available in person to help with these issues, online classes become useless. Yet, these factors play a crucial role in the student's development as a person. They teach the student discipline and time management. When a student skips an online class, the teacher will be able to know and punish them accordingly, whether it is lowering their grade or contacting their parents. This teaches the student not to skip classes.",Rebuttal
 but there are a wide variety of technological options students can choose from to fit their financial needs. There are also free alternatives such as using wifi and computers from a public library.,Rebuttal
"however many distance learning programs have classroom like resources students can use, such as video conferencing where students are not watching a prerecorded video, but are in real time with their teacher.",Rebuttal
 it should be known that student would not benefit from attending classes at home.,Rebuttal
"but you should'nt be home schooled just because your ""to tired"" and you dont want to wake up early in the morning. ",Rebuttal
"However, in this scenario the potential to do good outweighs the restrictions.",Rebuttal
"however,others may say that is a bad idea beacuse they can get bad grades.",Rebuttal
"However, they are incorrect because some students live far away and some of them don't want to feel frustrated or have problems at schools with others. In conclusion, it's very beneficial to be home schooled or take classes online because it solves a lot of problems and the student will be able to focus and do well. ",Rebuttal
they also might get bullied and become more shy. ,Rebuttal
"However, there are many possibilities and dangers outside of home that can ruin the students experience going to school and doing their classes there ",Rebuttal
 although that argument has little foundation. ,Rebuttal
"However, those people are wrong because most students in general do not like school.",Rebuttal
distance learning should be offered ,Rebuttal
"While this is understandable because the students would be in the comforts of their home rather than in a school building, and would be required to complete assignments that they otherwise would not if not forced to, this argument is false.",Rebuttal
but what it does mean is that the student will be help responsible for keeping up with their work as they progress through the curriculum ,Rebuttal
but in some cases it's just not possible and by giving them the chance to create a schedule that works for them it helps better prepare them for the future. ,Rebuttal
but by using time management skills he or she should be able to truly excel. ,Rebuttal
"Others like me would like to try it out to see if it would benefit us.
",Rebuttal
"This is incorrect because in life humans have to be comfortable with being uncomfortable, the only things humans can count on in life is change and discomfort ",Rebuttal
"However, Students will have the opportunity to explore a the different types of learning. visual learning and even audio learning could help students that could struggle with the traditional way of learning. It will open up students minds to learn from a different perspective that could make learning more enjoyable for students. ",Rebuttal
online can have just as many perks.,Rebuttal
"While they may not need more credits to graduate high school, college admission requirements can differ from high school graduation requirements, and some classes not offered at a school could be offered online so that a student could still attend college. ",Rebuttal
"This claim is incorrect because they could still get the virus with a healthy immune system, and they could potentially spread it to someone with a weak immune system if they caught the virus. ",Rebuttal
"While this may be true, distance learning could make it so one doesnt need to plan their classes around their kids school and extracurricular activities",Rebuttal
Most likely schools give you the materials needed to take online classes.,Rebuttal
"but, there are ways to avoid that.",Rebuttal
"but, at the same time there is much benefits from working at home then in school not only do you get to sleep more but you also get to basically do your thing but your own way. Students working at home can make a student independent instead of being dependent on their teachers. As a student it is honestly up to you to go to class and to focus on what you are being taught it shouldn't be your teachers job to make you go to class everyday yes we all need a push in life but not every person is going to help you out you have to be independent most times. ",Rebuttal
but they aren't without faults.,Rebuttal
the interactions are completely different.,Rebuttal
but it isn't good as an option to fully learn online.,Rebuttal
"However, the classroom always brings disturbites that causes the student to have a hard time focusing. Whether its from friends, other people or themselves. Some students can never learn since they never have the chance to fully focus in class",Rebuttal
"they , actually they would learn better because they would not have teachers bothering them about assignments they need to turn in ",Rebuttal
"but if students are really eager to take the class and want to learn, they will have no problem of learning courses. ",Rebuttal
"which is not correct. If students already know what they want to do in the future, it is better to spend more on it than going to school and not wasting time. ",Rebuttal
"However, online classes are challenging and it is not wrong to choose easy way when there is an option. ",Rebuttal
"these type of courses often result in a greater amount of negative effects on the individual taking them because they promote poor time-management, limit social skills, and reduce physical fitness ",Rebuttal
That was until I realized what I would be missing out on. ,Rebuttal
is invalid and only give room for more harassment of the student.,Rebuttal
"Although, being able to go into school and listen to teachers lectures or get resources will be far more beneficial ",Rebuttal
you are also gaining a lot.,Rebuttal
"however, online school does not give students the same hands-on-experience that the students in the classroom may recieve.",Rebuttal
"However, the weakness in that argument is that students tend to become more lazy and less focused when learning in a more comfortable setting.",Rebuttal
"But, everyone has people they interact with outside of school.",Rebuttal
"But, some students would prefer a distance learning because they feel they would benefit more from it.
",Rebuttal
"but some individuals may use this as an excuse to stay home and relax all day instead of doing what they're supposed to do, due to this there should be a few rules that prevent that from being the case. ",Rebuttal
"However, they are wrong because many students love to procrastinate doing work. So, giving them an option to work at their own pace will most likely result in late assignments, students forgetting about the assignments completely, or students just choosing not to do them. Basically, working at their own pace can lead to them not doing their work at all. ",Rebuttal
Going to school would set the students up for their future plans,Rebuttal
but there are always a solution the teacher could make a project that could involve working in groups,Rebuttal
"While online classes may not be for everyone, the option should be presented as the benefits are too great to ignore.",Rebuttal
While those who support distance learning want to help students they could be causing more harm to these students mentally ,Rebuttal
"but what may come easy or familiar to one person may not always be easy to another person. A good alternative to many of the problems brought about by a standard classroom setting is the development of distance learning based on new technology, ",Rebuttal
"but even if the teacher could see how many tabs were opened, the student could still use their phone or another digital device to look up answers.",Rebuttal
"Studies show that over 56% of students want to attend classes from home because of other reasons such as: being able to sleep in, use there phone without being told to get off of it by a teacher, and even being able to play the game and do there work.",Rebuttal
it can be argued that comfort was never a necessity when learning.,Rebuttal
but there are plenty of other things that I can list off.,Rebuttal
I feel that too much of it could end up hurting more than helping.,Rebuttal
"but those can easily be made up, and if need be, those classes can remain physical if thats what the school board needs, or what the students need to meet the graduation requirements. Again, its not that much different than regular schooling. ",Rebuttal
but in my opinion it is not wrong to take these online classes as long as the student is getting the education they need ,Rebuttal
" To solve this issue, schools require students to restart their laptops once a week in class in order to refresh the program and decrease the possibility of any technological issues ",Rebuttal
"These types of tendencies can easily be prevented by: the supervision of an adult along side a child, the removal of cellphones or other distractions for a period of time, the creation of a comfortable work environment being an office or space on the dining room table.",Rebuttal
 students will have a harder time transitioning to college,Rebuttal
Students in class with fellow peers and friends are more likely to be distracted by those who are alone at home ,Rebuttal
"Cheating is a issue that attacks all schools everywhere, but with online classes, locked mode on tests and open note exams are an option ",Rebuttal
"Online classes are not cheap, mine could have cost me up to 600 dollars, but luckily there are plenty of benefits in place to help those that may not be able to pay full price. If students were not to take the course seriously, they would suffer the consequences such as failing exams or not passing the course. ",Rebuttal
"Yes, distractions such as televisions and social media do exist, but how is that any different than in a school classroom. In fact, students in public schools have more distractions because they have to deal with not just their own school work, but also the people around them everyday. ",Rebuttal
the fact is that many online courses offer a grater access to faculty. Shy students are able to ask questons and receive the answer back almost inmediately. ,Rebuttal
"but being able to talk to other, classmates interact with them, getting help by your favorite teachers or if you need to somebody to talk to every student has a guidance consular ",Rebuttal
"but, sick students need their rest. If students have to be up in the morning till afternoon working at home while they are sick they would never get better. Unless a student is brought down with a long term sickness that could last longer than a month, then I don't think that they should use this method of learning from home. ",Rebuttal
"But I think it can benefit sometimes it can be a amazing idea for students to study home because they won't drop out of school. Students have different emotions that trigger them to want to leave school behind, since they start working more to pay bills that need to be paid each month.",Rebuttal
"However, students would not benefit from learning from home because schools offer face-to-face help, minimal distractions, and project-based learning that helps students learn essential life skills.",Rebuttal
but either way this keep going and many students fall sleep at their classes especially in the first two. This is one of many reason why this will be a good idea for students to use online courses. ,Rebuttal
bur either way not everything has only good or bad ideas just that we have to know how to use them.,Rebuttal
"Despite my reason taking classes at home are bad it's still a good thing that could benefit you in the end. It still has it ways of being challenging. Whos's to say it has to be easy to get better at it. The more you conference the better you get at asking for help and interacting with others, such as the teacher. Also multiply ways of getting it done and strategies.
",Rebuttal
"But, several classes need should defiantly have this option. Because if every class had this option there would be no point in having a physical school built or used.",Rebuttal
I disagree with these notions because online schooling is extremely beneficial for the same reasons some may consider it harmful.,Rebuttal
but that's incorrect.,Rebuttal
"but for some, a bus is a luxury that they don't have.",Rebuttal
"but this is simply false due to the fact that most school counselors aren't trained in helping students deal with a debilitating disease making an online education a better fit for most students dealing with these problems. By having an education packed into a computer screen, students are then encouraged to take their lives into their own hands, taking all power away from any illness or bully. ",Rebuttal
"however, they would not learn anything ",Rebuttal
"However, these reasons can be argued against. ",Rebuttal
"Many individuals argue whether or not students would be more benefited in public or home schooled classes. Home schooling makes some of the best benefits of independence. Including,the home schooled benefits of being in a recognized,homely environment ",Rebuttal
But the majority of the students can learn from videos and online classes. ,Rebuttal
"Nevertheless, there are other view points to consider",Rebuttal
your happiest place is home,Rebuttal
"Though these are some down sides of online classes they can easily be fixed,",Rebuttal
but that is not true,Rebuttal
"However, teachers may not have time to talk to different students with different problems all the time. Students taking online classes can send a message to the teacher or even video chat them to ask about the problem. Students taking online classes can also see how the lesson is shown on the screen than having the teacher explain it. Students can benefit from taking classes at home than attending classes at school. ",Rebuttal
"On the contrast, schools offering a distant learning program for students would greatly benefit them but making their presence known and it would help all the students who struggle in a public school and need a place more suitable for their learning needs.
",Rebuttal
"Even if more students skip class, implementing this system would ensure that all students know what happened in class whether they were present or not and will minimize the likelihood of a student falling behind. ",Rebuttal
only a small percentage of teenagers are in those desperate predicaments ,Rebuttal
they are incorrect ,Rebuttal
"On the other hand, in school you dont really get a choice of where you can complete your work, and the class you're in can be distracting. So, taking classes at home can be an better environment for you to focus. ",Rebuttal
"However, the children would be able to get the same amount of breaks they have in school, if not more. ",Rebuttal
"he reality is that as time goes on things ,such as schools, are going to evolve for the better and without change things won't grow and lead to more success.",Rebuttal
some argue that students would also be in enrolled in clubs to prevent understimulation. ,Rebuttal
Even though that maybe right most students don't care.,Rebuttal
The weakness in that is students in school usually learn through the use of computers or smart boards and rarely through the use of whiteboards.,Rebuttal
They are wrong because how can you have a social life when you have no time to meet new people.,Rebuttal
"They are wrong because how can a students learn something when they haven't practiced others ways of going about the problem.
",Rebuttal
They are wrong because being face to face with your teachers will help you understand the lesson in a better. ,Rebuttal
"but for some students, these interactions cause unnecessary stress that hinders their learning ",Rebuttal
"This is blasphemous because its neglectful of the students with straight A's, in AP classes, who still arent challenged.",Rebuttal
"but on the contrary people who are anti-social find it hard to speak in front of the class, work on group assignments, read for the class, or present their project in front of the class all of which can affect their grade. So these kids are now not only being graded on there knowledge but now also whether or not they're willing to carry out these task against their fears. ",Rebuttal
"However, I would definitely allow this option to a student who is in need for it.",Rebuttal
"However, distance learning is as encouraging for students at home or other locations as it is for students in class.",Rebuttal
but this is usually not the case.,Rebuttal
the structure of my class is a good representation of what most of the other online courses in my county would have been like. ,Rebuttal
"However, schools often implement strict regulations on phones, food, and talking as they know how much these things can be a distraction to a learning environment. ",Rebuttal
but it is far more prevalent in unsupervised situations. ,Rebuttal
" but in combination with having to read a screen for hours, the student must also be actively trying to learn difficult material, which becomes extremely straining on the eyes and taxing on the mind. ",Rebuttal
but students are going to pay more attention and have less stress ,Rebuttal
" It is true that students can work at their own time and speed through online classes, but being physically in a classroom provides more structure to the curriculum through already built in time ",Rebuttal
" While students may become distracted and not pay full attention to video lessons, the reality is that students also become distracted in physical school. ",Rebuttal
"This is not the case however, since all of their work is online they would not have much of an excuse to not have the assignment incomplete. Assessments will be monitored through sharing their computer screen and having access to their web cam. ",Rebuttal
they won't because they will get comfortable.,Rebuttal
"but doing this results in the child not knowing how to do the work. If they were not there when the lesson was taught, they would never be able to figure out the concept.",Rebuttal
that is only one person compared to a school of a thousand people.,Rebuttal
"If the student does not focus in school due to the surrounding people, The good education they would get online is more important. ",Rebuttal
but there incorrect ,Rebuttal
but the majority of kids would not ,Rebuttal
it is a perfectly viable option for students who need more personalized instruction and can help reduce stress from students who struggle socially. ,Rebuttal
"This is why, if distance learning were to be an option for students, the students would have to be approved for distance learning with actual reasons and evidence as to why they will benefit from it. ",Rebuttal
"they will still have to attend the video conferencing to get credit for being at school and attending class, so these students will not be missing anything. ",Rebuttal
" however, the students need to work hard for help their family and finish the schools for a job more better and get more money.
",Rebuttal
"However, Students would pay more attention to class at home because they don't have other students to distract them during class",Rebuttal
"Although online classes can become bewildering and stressful due to the compressed work load online students are given, students can graduate faster depending on how many courses they're enrolled in.",Rebuttal
"it is not worth the workload they have to deal with, and if they need help, there are virtual teachers who can help or they have the ability to ask someone for help at home. If they are able to work from home, they can be in a soothing and comforting setting and clear their mind because they are home, which can increase brain productivity which will make them have better grades ",Rebuttal
Those people are wrong because there are many ways to make friends like joining a sport team or making online friends.,Rebuttal
"On the other hand, students that attend to school can make friends and would have a better social life than the students attending by video conference. ",Rebuttal
"I have noticed that many of my classmates including myself have a very hard time concentrating when they are in a noisy environment, and they end up doing poorly on the assignment when it is loud. Working at school where it is quiet is the best place for students to succeed. ",Rebuttal
" but they are ill informed. Students are able to video chat and message with their own teachers. In classes such as science, students can watch their teachers do labs live, and they are able to communicate with eachother.",Rebuttal
but there are a lot of reasons why students will benefit better at school. ,Rebuttal
but the problem with that is that the students may not understand the material and assignment just by reading a few sentences. ,Rebuttal
at school I'm more secure in the lessons and I could understand more by having my teachers there physically explaining to me. ,Rebuttal
but there are so many good outcomes and advantages you have by attending classes at school . The teachers are more hands on at school and could truly help the students and guide them to the right path in a lesson more than they could on online courses. ,Rebuttal
"Having these classes doesn't mean that the student can't go out, they can easily get involved in extra curricular activities and make new friends. School isn't about being social its about getting your education so you can succeed ",Rebuttal
" Nevertheless, students are able to ask their teacher through an audio or facetime by the given technology of their computer. ",Rebuttal
but some students believe this type of learning is easier for them. ,Rebuttal
in fact the family can affect the student negatively more the positively by interrupting him while he is taking the course. ,Rebuttal
"However, being in a classroom environment can put students mind at ease, knowing there are others around who understand, and are going through the same thing. Doing classes this way would help teach each other to stay focus and keep one another in place. ",Rebuttal
but that feeling can get out of hand,Rebuttal
"However, the classes in online is wonderfure because is a way to spend with the family because they can make a day fun with them and make differents things like play football, wath a movie, they can go to the cinemark and other places that they prefers. ",Rebuttal
"actually students shouldn't attend to classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because students wouldn't learn the much as they learn at schools with teachers, and some students doesn't have internet or electronic devices at home to attend for online classes",Rebuttal
" However, students can have more time to sleep for those who work until midnight can be a benefit receiving those online classes, but to those students that doesn't work",Rebuttal
I extremely believe the opposite students shouldn't attend to the distance learning ,Rebuttal
"if it came down to having to take online classes or just go to school id rather take the online classes, speaking for my self i know that i have the requirements to take online classes others may disagree. ",Rebuttal
but online class has many ways to educate visual learners. ,Rebuttal
"Highschool students are not developed enough to be set free to do work assigned on their own time. There are some students that academically care and would take their work seriously, but a vast majority would not.",Rebuttal
I SAY NO TO THAT.,Rebuttal
"While understandable, that logic is flawed due to the fact that it is still possible to get accepted into a good university even if students only took online courses.",Rebuttal
others may need the quiet peace of their home to truly obtain the knowledge from a lesson.,Rebuttal
"while being correct, it is also arguable that it is a vital learning tool that enhances not only students ability to learn but also broadens the perspective on what can be learned.",Rebuttal
"however, student are more attentive while at home than at school ",Rebuttal
You have to think about what's best for students. What would help them succeed in life. What would make them want to better their future. ,Rebuttal
"This reasoning is understandable, however, it is also flawed due to the fact that online courses teach the same exact curricula that is taught in an actual class.",Rebuttal
I agree on all the reasons why they student shouldn't take distance learning as an option but I think otherwise. It's a great option for students because there are many student that fail or drop out of school just because they didn't attend school.,Rebuttal
"This is true because some students focus more when they are learning alone; however, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they may not understand.",Rebuttal
"However, physical presence plays a vital role in developing relationships and allowing students to overcome their social anxiety. ",Rebuttal
"however, those same distractions and procrastination feelings can still occur in the classroom with a teacher. ",Rebuttal
Distance learning could help with many things ,Rebuttal
but is staying home all the time really that fun. Dont you just want to get out there and have somewhere to be.,Rebuttal
there are still physical distractions that schools cannot stop.,Rebuttal
"There are two main fallacies in this argument: first, that bullying can still happen outside of school; and second, that this sheltering makes it easier for bullying to occur later in life. ",Rebuttal
Some people are different from others ,Rebuttal
but those things that some would consider a distraction can actually help the student.,Rebuttal
" but they don't know if the students are really working in they online classes because the distractions of video game or phones.
",Rebuttal
but there will also be amazing and terrible times in someone's life.,Rebuttal
"I believe that mental health would still be negatively affected if a person went the route of taking online classes because no matter if you are in a classroom or if you are at home, there is still social media and it is the number one cause of teen depression, not school.",Rebuttal
laziness or not getting work done does not always mean the person is a slacker. ,Rebuttal
however this will not help with their future endevours ,Rebuttal
"doing it as a school and seeing everyone united and having fun together gives a sense of belonging, and it makes them feel like they're part of a team. ",Rebuttal
"however, in the case of someone who has been bullied or harassed it can actually help them ",Rebuttal
"however, the student can buy a UV light protector for his computer screen or could take breaks within each class period.",Rebuttal
 they still learn communication skills,Rebuttal
"however, this is not a problem because learning from home is only an option and the grading system is still in place.",Rebuttal
"Then after a couple of years of having friends around me improved my communication skills which helped me improve my grades from a ""B"" to ""A"" because I started asking questions and putting myself out there and using my communication skills that I developed through having friends. ",Rebuttal
"when you have online classes and meet the teacher online for the first time you would not feel comfortable talking to her, just like a few of friends who experienced the same thing.",Rebuttal
"However, still proof that students would not benefit being able to attend classes from home. ",Rebuttal
"This cannot be true, students will not benfit any more than how they are taught in class, and there are deficits in learning that come along with online academic options. ",Rebuttal
but it is not nearly as productive in learning at school,Rebuttal
" This is true however, exposure should be conducted in a controlled environment where the student can be pulled out of if they become overwhelmed, not at school where most factors are uncalled for. ",Rebuttal
 but for other schools its perceived as a challenge and interference to other variables in their lives ,Rebuttal
"While this is true, this extra time is used in ways that can hurt the students life.",Rebuttal
for others is different they don't want to be in school because they have problems with other students or teachers and they want to stay away of all problems and the only place they have is at home and that is why they choose to have distance learning. ,Rebuttal
"but the major part of those students stay and home and do the distance learning for their save and protection.
",Rebuttal
A big problem I would actually have and some people might have as well is that some people don't have internet and they can't just do it from their phone because some people also don't have hotspot which would cause some problems ,Rebuttal
but they are wrong because everyone doesn't have access to these high levels of technology and it puts them at a disadvantage. The negatives far outweigh the positives for the use of online classrooms and video calls for education ,Rebuttal
"While this could be true, it can be easily fixed by talking with the teachers and creating a learning strategy that benefits everyone.
",Rebuttal
"for that reason, distance learning can be a great option for them.",Rebuttal
"While this statement does have some truth, it is not the whole story. ",Rebuttal
"However, this is untrue, as being able to take classes at home would actually increase attendance.",Rebuttal
"However, taking classes at home would be a big benefit to students. Students would take advantage of the ability to do school at home because they know how important an education is. ",Rebuttal
This sounds like very reasonable remark but they can easily be proven wrong.,Rebuttal
 But online classes can improve a students writing and communication skills. Having a one-on-one conversation with a video conference teacher can improve a students skills by just having a teacher to ask questions to. Going to classes at a school can also help student with such skills. But online classes can bring out the best in a student due to the one-on-one conversations. ,Rebuttal
"however, video conferencing allows the student to still be at home, but also learning face to face with their teacher or professor. Having all of your courses laid out with clarity through digital aspects shows that it would be easy for any person to become more organized and efficient though navigating these courses with clarity at home and managing your time well in a comfortable setting with efficiency. ",Rebuttal
", it would help prevent conflicts such as bullying. Staying at home with the responsibility to complete work should be desirable for any person wishing to pursue their educative life, no person should feel uncomfortable or in dismay when it comes to wanting to learn. ",Rebuttal
Its more beneficial to have offered home schooling to everyone. Just in case they do have a certain situation at their home or in their life where they need to be alone in order to concentrate and get work done. ,Rebuttal
"Therefore distance learning is just good for the mature students to do only. People that are anti social can use this so they want have to communicate with other people ,but when your in class you can grow out of being shy. ",Rebuttal
"The problem with this is that even though some schools do have built in days, a majority of schools do not.",Rebuttal
"While this is true, buying a computer is significantly cheaper than building a school or buying buses.",Rebuttal
"Which at the end will be bad for them because they won't benefit from anything. However, they won't get to do school activities such as school dances, pep rallies and even get to watch sports games.",Rebuttal
 But these problems can easily be fixed compared to the ones that prevents certain students from attending ,Rebuttal
"But to that I would say; there have also been many successful people in history such as scientist, Albert Einstein and entrepreneur, Gary Vee, who either dropped out of high school or didn't find themselves doing so great until university.",Rebuttal
"but this does not apply to every student. Students should at least have the option to be on top of their work, which distance learning provides. ",Rebuttal
She does not choose to miss school on purpose; it is a result of what she loves to do.,Rebuttal
"This is not true; the pressure of a public environment is not equivalent to being in a familiar, safe environment like an individual's room. ",Rebuttal
"however, they are wrong because distance learning reduces chances of receiving or giving illnesses and gives students a chance to not fall behind in school.",Rebuttal
"clearly, they are wrong because they won't fall behind in their absence and it gives students and alternate learning environment. ",Rebuttal
"however, they are wrong because distance learning prevents wide-spread illnesses from affecting students and students are not aware of how safe school is for their health.
",Rebuttal
It will not going to be the same because they will not have many friends as they would like to have to do and share amazing things.,Rebuttal
"But, others say that learning from the confront of your own home helps you do better and then you do not have to worry about how long you take and how much time that you take to review so that you are well prepared. Students receive their education through learning online just as well as they do sitting in a classroom. ",Rebuttal
"This reasoning is plausible, however, in my experience, there are far more distractions at school than at home in isolation ",Rebuttal
But learning behind a computer screen shouldn't be the solution we choose. We can try to improve the school system or promote telling teachers and trusted ones if someone is getting bullied. Just because there is negative interaction doesn't mean we should limit interaction entirely,Rebuttal
"but, charging chrome books everyday and running the risk of it breaking isn't any more convenient than a crowded hallway.",Rebuttal
but we should be blessed to have a free public school. ,Rebuttal
"but sometimes this can bring negative effects for the student, because they could fall behind compared to the students in the same grade as them, by learning at a slow pace or getting distracted, losing focus is more likely to happen while being at home due to all the distractions that we have there,",Rebuttal
"However, there are steps that can be taken to limit off-task student activity: students could be limited to certain applications or browser extensions or be monitored by a parent or guardian ",Rebuttal
"However making it necessary for children to come to school teaches students independence and self-reliance, clears all distractions away from students by having them sit in a classroom, and allows time for students to ask teachers questions about topics that they do not understand before class begins, giving the student one-on-one time ",Rebuttal
it does not amount to the distractions there are in one's household which will allow students to be focused on learning if they were to physically attend school ,Rebuttal
"But when she has to take the AP exam in person, she fails the exam by a wide margin due to her lack of knowledge on the subject ",Rebuttal
"This is not true, although it is online and they learn and keep mostly up to date the student would not receive the handouts and worksheets the teacher has given out. The students would receive zeros for this incomplete work. it is designed to give the students a fighting chance against the zeros they would receive but also cannot be abused.",Rebuttal
but what else can they do than stare at a computer all day? ,Rebuttal
"However, learning at home by a way of online classes or video conferencing could be better for any student currently attending a public or private school.",Rebuttal
but I think that is false ,Rebuttal
"But because students are provided with more distractions, do not receive much hands-on experience or practice, and are prevented from getting the true school experience that they deserve, they should not take online classes from home and instead proceed with taking regular classes at their local school.
",Rebuttal
"that does not mean that there are not many things the schools can do to help those specific students. For example, Schools could talk to their staff on how is the best way to teach students with certain setbacks ",Rebuttal
but some would not do well with this change or would abuse the system ,Rebuttal
but not fully ,Rebuttal
"however, that is not the case most of the time. ",Rebuttal
"However, what the opposition refuses to mention is that those few students are reprimanded for their poor quality of work and receive a low grade. Deadlines are firm in online classes, and students partaking in them will learn to hold themselves responsible for the quality of work they produce ",Rebuttal
"However, these extracurriculars actually account for most of the social skills and companionships students must gain to grow as people ",Rebuttal
"Clearly, creating the option for students to attend online classes is a much more reasonable idea ",Rebuttal
"Thus, the option of online classes should be implemented in schools around the world.",Rebuttal
"it gives students a chance to be safe, comfortable, and happy!",Rebuttal
however It's not a valid point because there are even bigger concerns that society is facing today.,Rebuttal
Which brings me to my first reason; being able to have one on one time with their instructors,Rebuttal
"These arguments do not factor in students who are not competitive enough to apply for academies, cannot afford to, or simply do not wish to attend these academies",Rebuttal
but not everyone have that opportunity,Rebuttal
"Where as if I'm at home I can be free complete things on my time, I can take time on my assignments, I don't have to compare myself to others, and I can be me. At home there is no one to judge and I feel more comfortable to work at home.",Rebuttal
 However they are incorrect because adults have no idea how much tress and pressure they're putting in their children.,Rebuttal
"I also dont like public school because theres drama, fights, fire drills and basic stuff that can easily throw you off your focus game. ",Rebuttal
"they dont take into consideration that once these downfalls of the school system have been fixed by online schooling, students can see and enjoy firsthand what learning the the right environment can be like. Students will want to learn. Students will want to experience the joy of knowledge.",Rebuttal
"However, there's more reasons for students to attend classes from home rather then at school. ",Rebuttal
" distance learning can still cause major problems when you actually look at it. Home schooling, distance learning or whatever you want to call it is really allowing are kids to be lazy when it comes to learning. We are literally giving our kids a crutch right before our eyes and we don't even see it.",Rebuttal
"However, people by attending to classes have the chance to get help from teachers ",Rebuttal
but most online programs have a select amount of work you have to do or you fail the class. ,Rebuttal
"it is clear that online school will not only cause short term problems, but also long term ",Rebuttal
"however, while public schools may not cost money they could cost a life and the staff present do not always watch over the children as they have promised ",Rebuttal
Schools should offer students to take the classes from home because it would benefit the students and help them avoid the sticky situations of not knowing the topic because they missed a class. ,Rebuttal
this is not true,Rebuttal
it is better to have a social life rather than learning at home alone.,Rebuttal
"however, You will have more free time, students could go out and make friends and socialize outside, technology keeps improving and online courses will improve as well throughout time ",Rebuttal
"i think this can help they because we need to try new things for make different this in the school, maybe make cool activity.
",Rebuttal
as technology advances so will schools and how they catch students cheating on a test or an essay ,Rebuttal
students should not attend classes from home,Rebuttal
"however, for some, it is extremely difficult for them to focus in a traditional learning environment.",Rebuttal
"But scool can be equally distracting for some students, and perhaps the more streamlined and simplified teaching style would benefit students with short attention spans or conditions like attention deficit disorder. One never really knows until the time comes. ",Rebuttal
Students should be allowed to attend school how they want to . If a students becomes lazy because of distance learning the problem is within the student. Many will agree that it will make a student less lazy and more responsible. ,Rebuttal
"but comes with unforeseen issues that can dramatically affect students' quality of education. The fallibility of students' dedication to learning is often something that is not taken into account, even though it is something that is easily predictable. ",Rebuttal
"That reject to be in certain place. You're free to study and work without any restrain. All you need is to manage your time.

You be able to kill two birds on the same shot. ",Rebuttal
"But ultimately, online class's are a privilege and resource which should be taken advantage of ",Rebuttal
"I would argue that as long as the student is interested, wants to take the class, and works hard, that the student will reap the rewards of their extra work. ",Rebuttal
"libraries are available for those driven and determined to better themselves.
",Rebuttal
"Because of this, students may have to seek out additional resources to fully understand the material that is being presented to them.
",Rebuttal
but to other people it does matter ,Rebuttal
"However, this problem would be dissolved with the use of video conferencing. Teachers can use technology to speak to their students using platforms such as FaceTime or Skype. Students would have the same enriching educational experience over a video conference. ",Rebuttal
"Clearly, that would be an option for a student to use as far as seeing their family, but it's not the same as being able to have a real connection and presence of your family everyday.",Rebuttal
"However, why would students run the extra mile of receiving their education, when it can be easily be obtained in another way. ",Rebuttal
"Clearly, they are wrong because educational organizations must support the needs of every student despite the amount of how much help they need.
",Rebuttal
but not others because there are many problems it could lead too.,Rebuttal
but it's better for the student to physical go to school and learn.,Rebuttal
"Without outside control, it is easy to understand why one would think that. However, just because school is online doesn't mean there aren't punishments ",Rebuttal
"This is a good point however, the benefits still out weigh the negatives ",Rebuttal
Well students and teachers both have emails that they can ask question and answer the questions the student has. ,Rebuttal
online school would be for student who miss 3 or more day and in the long run falling behind and and having a pile of work to come back to hurts so much more than not having a break. ,Rebuttal
but these kids are building a brand and making money in a capitalistic society ,Rebuttal
but this is not true. Those who tend to believe that is because they may prefer working alone or just like to cheat. ,Rebuttal
but there are many cons then pros with distance learning.,Rebuttal
but I believe that long distance classes would not benefit the student's learning.,Rebuttal
which is totally wrong ,Rebuttal
" Despite this, the pros of learning online greatly outweigh the cons, especially when the student is hardworking and motivated.
",Rebuttal
"However, learning through online or video conferences will limit the students social skills",Rebuttal
"however, the 21st century, and more importantly the 20's, are going to get a lot more digital, a lot more online, and a lot more connected through the internet.",Rebuttal
but knowing certain work ethics and how some students think; the idea of having online video chatting for lessons is a really negative outcome.,Rebuttal
"On the other hand though, it's more freedom.",Rebuttal
"While you're in school you can peacefully finish all your work in class and ask for a question, or even help from the teacher, but if you're taking online classes your only source is most likely going to be a online source, or the guides they give you online which might not be always correct.",Rebuttal
"This is why going to school is more efficient. The people that go to school have no worries just bring all the materials they need for class and work and pay attention. Also students can have more time to work and can be actively speaking with our teachers too, for questinos and answers to help students ",Rebuttal
"but without a teacher to watch for cheating, many students use the internet to look up answers and falsely increase their scores.",Rebuttal
many students fall under the control of procrastination.,Rebuttal
"However, while physical schooling leads to small, short periods of procrastination, online schooling allows students to procrastinate the entire course over months. In addition, procrastination is increased with online schooling as the students' homes act as classrooms.",Rebuttal
"but as the end of the course nears, there will be no time at all for studying or hanging out with friends.",Rebuttal
"These individuals are wrong because when a student is being home schooled, they don't have the same experience socializing with others as someone who goes to a public school, therefor also not gaining as much skills as someone who isn't home schooled. ",Rebuttal
"These people are wrong because when students are home schooled, they don't get that many opportunities to interact with others and end up not knowing how to act around others. ",Rebuttal
"However, the ratio of those who are unable to attend a traditional school to those who are is very small. Many students would take advantage of this ""distance learning"" opportunity and use it for an easier education rather than a better one. There are several types of accommodations one can receive for illness or any other obstacle that hinders their education; allowing any person, without such disabilities, to receive these accommodations endangers them and their education. ",Rebuttal
having a schooling option that you can take at your own pase and in a comfortable evironment is more benefitial to a student.,Rebuttal
"In fact, allowing students to work from their homes actually works to inhibit the creative mindset ",Rebuttal
"However, new scholarship programs have now emmerged to assist these students, as well as various support programs in order to obtain the acesss to education they need and deserve.",Rebuttal
" but the parent may have to go to work or run errands throughout the day, which would create a loophole for the students to have access to the various electronics in the house. ",Rebuttal
" however it is still more of a workload compared to if they were at a school. With being over reliant on technology, a majority of the students attending classes online would be prone to missing their classes due to technological issues which would prohibit them from acquiring the academic material being taught that day. ",Rebuttal
"but, not every student learns the same.",Rebuttal
" Although this is a reasonable concern, there is no need to worry. Students will be able to work with teachers online and there will still be teacher guidance within these classes. Online classes still have a grade book and many times, these classes offer live calls/chats with the teachers. Students will be able to work on their own time and still maintain grades",Rebuttal
"While these issues can potentially be crippling, many schools are becoming aware and go to great lengths to remedy them. ",Rebuttal
"However, this is not true because the students still get the human interaction they need and they still have the same work due at the same time. ",Rebuttal
" even offering a nuanced opportunity towards the development of valuable time management skills, typical in-school education provides critical social benefits that an isolated, online-based school environment would struggle to provide. ",Rebuttal
"Although some of it is true, online classes should not be necessary ",Rebuttal
" I agree there is those who choose to do the wrong thing and try to cheat the system, but I have known many dedicated people who have taken online courses who always try to use the resources given to them to make the most out of their education.",Rebuttal
most of them would not be as happy as they are if they did not attend school.,Rebuttal
"That is not the case because in high school you strictly only learn. You walk into the classroom to sit down and not talk for 90 minutes. You hardly ever interact with the students around you because you are forced to learn. If you were learning from home that is exactly how it would be, but better because of the beneficial factors. The only difference is that there is a one centimeter screen between the teacher and student.
",Rebuttal
"While all of these arguments are possible, there are still many benefits to kids using online school or video confrencing becasue of circumstances that many people don't understand. ",Rebuttal
there are clearly a lot of positive aspects of deciding on taking one's classes online.,Rebuttal
"This issue is no longer as present as before with the improvements in technology and as new online platforms are appearing that help students to interact, ask question, or review lessons are being created and are gaining popularity such as Edpuzzle, Khan Academy, Google Classroom and much more",Rebuttal
 but it wouldn't be as beneficial as going to school physically ,Rebuttal
 it is important to go to school ,Rebuttal
In this case it would be so much easier to just try to attend classes at school. Attending school online may seem fun though it is not as easy as many may think ,Rebuttal
"However I argue that the cost if worth it, if kids who are sick can still do well on the tests. Additionally, sometimes you can pay attention in class and still not understand a concept so, conferencing teachers could help. In my opinion, the benefits far outweigh the costs when it comes to video conferencing. ",Rebuttal
"However, online school would, in fact, help students gain social skills as they are able to have more free time for sports, jobs, and even hanging out with friends. It also would help students gain the skill of time management",Rebuttal
but at the end of the day I think that online school would be more beneficial than public. ,Rebuttal
"This looks over the fact that theres only so much a teacher can do from behind a computer screen to ensure their students are learning, if there is even a teacher supervising at all.",Rebuttal
"This is just not true, if you are someone who won't be able to work with a large group going to school will defeat its purpose because you won't be able to even learn properly. Also forcing someone with anxiety in those types of situation can just make it worse. Proving how helpful away from school leaning can be.
",Rebuttal
the classroom brings a lot of tension and is not for everyone. ,Rebuttal
"but when you have the motivation and determination you find yourself learning more and becoming a better student.
",Rebuttal
however the teenage mindset does not change from the bed to the to home office ,Rebuttal
" I used to have online class, and

""in my opinion online class is very hard"" ",Rebuttal
" But I think with excess time and freedom the students stress factors will reduce, which will help them develop a healthy work ethic and resilience. Which means that work wont be a problem for them and theyll develop independence. ",Rebuttal
but the modern American student is not being prepared to work in either of these places.,Rebuttal
"but what is so beneficial from attending a school is that students are exposed to other ideas developed by other students, and can participate in engaging discussions to make further achievements.",Rebuttal
those that are not educated in a school aren't receiving the same fulfillment and educational opportunities as those who are educated in a school environment.,Rebuttal
" but they allow for more mistakes, and less knowledge gained through them. ",Rebuttal
but it takes a big chunk out of your day when you could be doing something else as equally important ,Rebuttal
the benefits overpower the disadvantages.,Rebuttal
 but the amount of pros that come from regular school is insurmountable.,Rebuttal
"in reality, online schooling makes schools more accessible to students with needs that can not be met in a classroom setting and allows student to continue having class even on sick days or days of weather cancellations.
",Rebuttal
" but as students grow older and start to narrow in on their post graduation plans, they often feel as if they can't afford to miss a day due to illness or weather. Online schooling would take all the stress of missing class away. ",Rebuttal
" At my current school, there are regulations and rules that prevent this from happening. Students without accommodations are required to attend school if there is not a valid excuse for an absence. ",Rebuttal
online classes are an additional option for students to take.,Rebuttal
 but distance learning simply exists as an additional option for students to take advantage of. ,Rebuttal
"However, students can develop and hone these skills with continuing to take in person classes at school. ",Rebuttal
"This argument can be rebutted, as those who choose online courses would actually have more time to be social",Rebuttal
Lets be real one of the biggest reasons is that there lazy. ,Rebuttal
To me I still dont think thats enough evidence and detail to say I would stay home. ,Rebuttal
"On the other hand, schooling at home, the students can easily look up the answers on the internet on a different device. So for all that matter it was you choose from not what want, it what you need. ",Rebuttal
there are buses from schools that can take students from one school to another.,Rebuttal
Even with some downsides to online learning there are more positives then negatives.,Rebuttal
"This isn't true because students can do anything from their phone to get distraced from work, they might not understand what the online instructions is trying to say, they might not want to communicate with their parents sometimes ",Rebuttal
" students will perform better if they are hands on.
",Rebuttal
the experience is way different then if they were to be with each other physically learning how to productively cooperate with people sitting right next to them. ,Rebuttal
" I think many schools are starting to give out issued laptops to their students. If that is not the case or they dont have WIFI, they could always go to the nearest library and make use of the resources there.",Rebuttal
"yet it ironically hinders their efforts and understandings. School schedules will have a set plan of each day, and each class will have teachers that plan the way the subject is being tought. Having a plan to follow will prevent students to get a set work done by a certain time. ",Rebuttal
"however, having classes online would be beneficial ",Rebuttal
"Although, this is incorrect because the initial reason that a student does not complete assignments is because they are rushed in other classes.",Rebuttal
 a parent will have other things to do leading back to the mess of distractions that will form. ,Rebuttal
but it is outweighed by the disadvantages ,Rebuttal
However online classes won't put students at a disadvantage ,Rebuttal
Distance learning will not be required but offered so if one does not have internet they will proceed to attend school how they usually would. Also if students wanted a more hands on learning they could just attend regular school instead of taking the class online. ,Rebuttal
"Wrong, due to the convinience of having school at home there would be almost no excuse for missing it other then oversleeping but then the teacher can just contact the students parent or guardian. I was asked by a peer ""wouldnt lunch and bathroom breaks not be a thing then?"" No, one would use the restroom and can eat lunch at their own schedule instead of having to constantly ask the teacher or wait for a set time to eat which is one of my favorite personal benefits of distance learning. ",Rebuttal
"While this could be true to students who only take these online classes, this doesn't mean that the real classroom is disappearing. These classes are meant for certain situations or students and are often used as a second option. ",Rebuttal
but I think you miss a lot and all the experience that you could get at school. I personally don't think it would benefit missing all that and knowing how it would be. When you get a job that you dont have the option to do it home in the computer so how would you learn and know what it's like. ,Rebuttal
allowing them to take online classes would in fact promote responsibility and productivity within the student. ,Rebuttal
"but by allowing students to take their classes online when injured, it allows them to heal with minimal discomfort while missing no class instruction. ",Rebuttal
"If students are not taught how to set aside their time and plan, while being able to be unsupervised, then the schooling system is setting these students up to struggle in the real world once they leave high school ",Rebuttal
"With the rising amount of research and development, however, this might soon cease to be an issue.",Rebuttal
"They are wrong because parents aren't professionally trained, like teachers, to know what material their child needs to learn for one class, let alone seven classes.",Rebuttal
"But, going to school is better because students or parents won't have to pay for the online lessons its simply free and effective.",Rebuttal
However distance learning teaches productivity to students in doing work they otherwise would have missed ,Rebuttal
"I do not fully disagree with them, students should try to go to school as much as they can. But it would be nicer to have, lets say a child misses the bus, they will still be graded, or say that child is sick, they can still work. ",Rebuttal
"There are multiple reasons why these claims are incorrect. Some students are not able to understand certain topics due to how they are presented at school. Every student learns and retains information in different ways, and some classes are harder for students to understand due to how they are taught. ",Rebuttal
 so why not provide equal opportunity and allow the student to decide what works best for them. Students who are distracted easily tend to learn better at home in an environment that they are familiar with. ,Rebuttal
"This idea of distance learning wouldn't be a suggestion if it hasn't already worked, which would mean that the students felt a responsibility and finished their said class or task.
",Rebuttal
"Although it may be cheaper for counties, we shouldn't take the cheaper route when we're talking about the future of our country. These students will be the future of America, and we need them to be knowledgeable and healthy men and women. ",Rebuttal
" However, one can still catch a virus or sickness just from their parents or from going out to do mundane tasks ",Rebuttal
"however, the cons outweigh the pros. Both feeling sick and social anxiety are issues a human must overcome, and online classes are only a short term relief ",Rebuttal
but its definitely worth a try if you really need it.,Rebuttal
"they are wrong ,because if student take class in school they would get more benefit, like help from the teacher when they don't understand the subject . ",Rebuttal
That's not true because when you hear so many stories and people talking about their experiences with home schooling you have to take to consideration that maybe it helps some and not others. ,Rebuttal
" but if he's fed up with it then maybe it was the best decision you can only handle so much hate.
",Rebuttal
"It benefited her in so many ways, she no longer is afraid of what people think of her on social media. Sometimes people need space from public school and then when they feel that they are ready they can go to public schools again. ",Rebuttal
"however some students learn better at home, by themselves. ",Rebuttal
"but I just can't agree with that. In school, you have loud people messing around, rumors and gossip distracting people, and friends always trying to talk to each other.",Rebuttal
I think actions can be taken to prevent cheating of any kind. ,Rebuttal
However they are wrong because students are going to do there work and they are going to get a more better understanding of there work.,Rebuttal
it is still not for everyone ,Rebuttal
",but, it is not a good idea ",Rebuttal
"But most say that being able to make up everything that has been missed can also encourage the people and students to want to be in school more so they wont have to worry about catchig up at home on the online classes, it can cause them to want to finsih eveything in class so there would be no reason for make ups. ",Rebuttal
"While this view is understandable, it is incorrect because students who attend online classes do just as well as students who learn at school. ",Rebuttal
"While this view may be understandable, it is incorrect because students that attend classes from home have many greater benefits to their health through the improvement of sleep, shown by many scientific studies stating that teenagers require at least 8 to 9 hours of sleep a night, but less than half of the population get this amount ",Rebuttal
"While this is understandable, it is incorrect because students who are confident in their unique selves are able to cooperate better with other people.",Rebuttal
"Allowing students to have the option of completing school online would put a lot of responsibility on them, which would help to prepare them for life in the real world. ",Rebuttal
but the pros outweigh the cons when it comes to online school,Rebuttal
"but being social and going out isn't always a good thing. Some students are anti-social, and fear the thought of social interaction;",Rebuttal
"However, that is not a concern that schools should worry about",Rebuttal
you can argue that there are many distractions at school as well. ,Rebuttal
"Though you may not have a teacher in the room with you to hep tell you what to do; there are many other resources you can use now, such as YouTube,Google, and you can even email a teacher or professor and get your answers through them.",Rebuttal
however there can be just as many or more distractions at home as there are at school. Students could wind up on their phone or playing video games and wasting a lot of time when they could be learning.,Rebuttal
in many different and meaningful ways could be a distraction to the learning of the youth. ,Rebuttal
But it is also good because students who have bad grades or cant focus in a classroom setting can take the oppertunity to use distance learning to pass there classes with ease. ,Rebuttal
"but with the increasing growth of technology, most places offer free wifi, and all Generic_City libraries have computers for the public to use",Rebuttal
But students get more distract stay near the family and they don't want to pay attention. ,Rebuttal
it would be worth it for lots of school systems around the world ,Rebuttal
"however ,I think that students that take classes online male the same effort because they need to have time to take those classes and they have to respect the schedule that teachers give to them to attend class, they have to be in front of the computer a lot of time that can is not good but they do it because they want to graduate like other students wants.",Rebuttal
"I refute this point, by stating that to learn and grow we must be placed outside of our comfort zones and forced to experience new things that we typically could not at home. We cannot grow in a stagnant environment. Looking at a computer screen every day, is not the best way to stimulate young minds, they must be provided with experiences that they can learn from first handedly. ",Rebuttal
"but should not be looked down upon just because the lack of social communication a child may have, as long as the child graduates and tends to do really well with their progress in online classes then there is no reason that they should be put into public or private education, unless said otherwise by the student themselves. ",Rebuttal
Those individuals should be focussing on recovering rather than their education. ,Rebuttal
"Online schooling may be useful for children who are to sick to attend school, however it does not provide any useful advantage to students who are capable of attending school normally.

Also, students who are not physically able to attend school for medical reasons should be focusing on recovering rather than schoolwork.
",Rebuttal
but at least when you are an adult and more independent you will have the luxury of picking what you eat for lunch or even bringing in your own chair. ,Rebuttal
but most cannot. ,Rebuttal
but that just is not the case.,Rebuttal
"However, working from home makes it easy for students to get sidetracked, and leaves students with little guidance from a teacher.",Rebuttal
"Past dangers from other students, they would be far away from potential disease spread at school, one of the easiest place for viruses and sickness to spread due to sharing of learning materials and small closed classrooms.",Rebuttal
"While this may all sound good, The quality of the learning would still be far behind that of a normal school no matter how many specific classes there are and how safe the schools would be, students would still be distanced and their education would be mediocre at best. ",Rebuttal
"They are wrong because it's much easier to cheat online with a very low chance of getting caught.
",Rebuttal
"On the contrary, they are extremely wrong because you wouldn't be able to see them everyday as you normally do during the school day. ",Rebuttal
"However, this could result in the students becoming lazy and making poor choices.",Rebuttal
"Maybe this can affect the student that dosen't have internet access at home, for those case the school have another options for them.
",Rebuttal
"Poverty has made up about 53% of our country .For those people, how will they ever learn if they don't have the resources in order to become what they can?75% of students in poverty depend on the food the school serves them as well. If i didnt know when or where the next breakfast and lunch was coming from ,i would expect to learn and eat at a public school. ",Rebuttal
These reasons will not justify the amount of people that benefit from being able to take online classes.,Rebuttal
"However, with online school parent would be able to check when their kid log in in and for long and also what they have done. ",Rebuttal
"However, some student may need to take easier classes.",Rebuttal
"However, there are other ways to spread them, but schools are the biggest way.",Rebuttal
"However, they're wrong because a lot of people fail and get behind.",Rebuttal
this comfort does not make up for all of the things that could possibly distract them,Rebuttal
 students still miss out on having people to talk to that have nothing to do with their family. Being able to go to a counselor or teacher you trust with something that is bothering you is one of the best things a student can get out of school ,Rebuttal
"learning to deal with judgment is an important skill. If students are not exposed to it early on, how will they deal with it when they are adults. ",Rebuttal
"but, that probably was not ""your"" intention.",Rebuttal
"I believe however that the parents if they choose to, should force their child to do the work ",Rebuttal
"Because of the evidence and reasoning presented, having a physical learning experience is incredibly more beneficial having a learning system online. ",Rebuttal
" However, we later found out that most people were looking up the answers online when the class average for the real test came out to be unexpectedly low.",Rebuttal
"online schooling opens students' eyes to the idea that knowledge is a living, breathing force that surrounds everything and, while incorporating elements of grading and standardization, shifts the focus more onto individual students testing their limits and discovering their abilities fro themselves. ",Rebuttal
"However, there are many misconceptions about online classes. Although it may seem like the student is taking the class alone, there are always others enrolled at the same time ",Rebuttal
but it would actually help those students make friends with other classmates that live farther away from them.,Rebuttal
but it actually does the opposite.,Rebuttal
"But they are choosing their life in those moments and if a students wishes to cheat or not attend, when thrown into their future the only person that is hurting in the end is their selves. That is their decision and their education, and the program may then be giving them the biggest life lesson they would ever receive. ",Rebuttal
" However, having to work independently would ultimately benefit students because it would cause them to become more responsible.",Rebuttal
" however, distance learning would actually teach participating students to be more independent and responsible over their schoolwork, which could prepare them for college. Learning from home is up to the student's maturity level because they need to be able to take initiative on their own work without a teacher being there to tell them to.",Rebuttal
"Since the distance learning video is sharing and connecting to other students, the teachers will make everything shorter enough to help students understand new lessons. It also hard because some students can't write or copy down what the teachers said. But overall, it's not a bad option at all. ",Rebuttal
I do not feel that way ,Rebuttal
this is false because the consequences of not doing the work would effect everything in their life.,Rebuttal
others may not.,Rebuttal
but this is simply the entire point of individualized learning through online classes.,Rebuttal
"However, I can assure you that with minimal research and effort you can find a multitude of activities that fit your likes and needs in your community or even a high level club program run by a private organization.
",Rebuttal
" however, it is still possible to communicate effectively online.",Rebuttal
"In the past, before online conferencing was suggested, schools have already dealt with this issue.

Usually, students will get their work ahead of time or periodically and then when they are able to return to school, they catch up with the teacher's assistance.

In the end, that person should recover nicely.
",Rebuttal
but that saying is not true because online school has proven to many parents and students that it is a less stress zone and more beneficial to students. ,Rebuttal
"Each student who attends online school should make sure they are responsible for being on top of their work each day, especially since there is no teacher to physically remind them to turn in assignments. ",Rebuttal
"However, the problem is whether or not they would pay attention in class, not whether or not they can be present on class or not, not if thats any help anyway due to the second reason why. ",Rebuttal
"However, if the student in question's device is their parents device, then they would easily impersonate as their said parent or guardian to trick the teacher,or even the county to believe that they are sick, or they could simply not log in to their classes, nor do any online homework. ",Rebuttal
"However there will be a big problem concerning the budget to replace the laptop if the device is broken, or handled roughly, then it the problem would go back to square one, except with the added weight of replacing broken school property. ",Rebuttal
"However, attending a school environment can award students with more opportunities. ",Rebuttal
 this just isn't a valuable argument ,Rebuttal
"students will be missing various skill that can be only be gained in school,",Rebuttal
"School is a serious matter, and students could benefit from being allowed to decide and have a say on what they want.",Rebuttal
"Complete and respectable thoughts, but learning at home for students with certain circumstances still is as beneficial and or more beneficial, then physically going into a school.",Rebuttal
"However, since distance learning gives students more choice, they can choose how and when they interact with their peers, allowing social relationships to be built on their own time rather than during school time. ",Rebuttal
"However, online learning still retains all of the traditional benefits that come from learning in a classroom.",Rebuttal
But why would a student take advantage of the World Wide Web at home when they have all the time in the world to complete their assignments and where they already perform better on their homework? Stooping grades will become the first wake up call for students taking advantage of the ease of modern technology. ,Rebuttal
"However, being at home more often will instinctively encourage students to venture out of their familiar environmnt and seek beneficial relationships with other students. The group video conferences that will be provided by online programs will give students the tools they need to interact with their teachers and have meaningful discussions about their acdemics and improvment. ",Rebuttal
they are entirely incorrect.,Rebuttal
" But the reality is, all the kids will see is just a face. They won't see the emotions the other kids have, the interests they might share, the fun they could have playing together. All the kids would see is just another face on another screen, it would mean nothing to them.
",Rebuttal
" Regardless of this, bullies and the stressful factors of school would be completely taken away, an extremely beneficial factor for the average student. ",Rebuttal
"However, this is quite the opposite, as virtual education provides many benefits that even normal schools would most likely be not able to help. ",Rebuttal
 home schooling would not,Rebuttal
"Truthfully, learning at home only causes distractions and clueless students.",Rebuttal
"But still disagree because students will no have options to pick elective classes because they will only have to take classes that are eligible to take by using computers or papers,",Rebuttal
"however, the education system should be guiding their students to think that way, rather than assuming they already do ",Rebuttal
"however, experiencing distractions teaches the student how to work in stressful situations for the real world. It may also accentuate the fact that one cannot escape distractions, as someone will find them anywhere they go.",Rebuttal
As fun as that sounds some students will not be able to meet their friends because their friends might have a different sechdules then their other friends.,Rebuttal
"Both of those ideas, however, are false. Most high school students do not put in the effort to dress nicely for school everyday already, they would rather be comfortable then look nice. Through video chatting, students have the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers, everyone needs social interaction and distance learning takes that into account. Many students find it easier to learn while sitting at a desk or table, both of which are very common in any household, therefore, students lazing around in bed while learning is highly unrealistic. ",Rebuttal
"however in contrast some may actually work better in a noisy environment due either to preference, or due to ADHD or other similar mental disorders, which cause affected students to feel more comfortable with noise to keep them entertained.",Rebuttal
"however, this system will undoubtedly bring more good than bad.",Rebuttal
"Those people don't understand that slacking in an online class can affect your transcript, because your grade can constantly go down. Also, some schools require certain GPA's to take Standardized tests, in order to decide, if the student qualifies or not. In many cases, people rephrase from failing online and video courses, because the teachers or providers of the lessons tend to be a little harder on the student than normal teachers. ",Rebuttal
"This is not true because even while students are not attending school, they have to complete the assignments or notes given to them, and of course the teacher is capable of viewing what work has been completed.",Rebuttal
"Students that are easily sidetracked at home are also easily distracted at school, however at school students that have this issue end up distracting other students. At home, they may have fewer distractions, and would not be able to interrupt and affect the learning quality of other students. ",Rebuttal
students won't adchieve if we let them attend classes from home.,Rebuttal
"but the question is ""do you have the money to pay collage?"". ",Rebuttal
"Yet, some things are inevitable, no matter where you go all of those things are possible. Having online classes requires you to log in, this causes a problem because they may forget to log in or may not log in on purpose. You can catch an illness by just laying in bed, having online school does not stop the spread of sickness but just slows it down. Bullying happens in our daily life, having it happen to a student helps him or her learn how to deal with it. ",Rebuttal
"it is the most common form of consistent social exposure for young people.
",Rebuttal
", but it is unlikely that many would follow the strict lifestyle needed for the disciplined environment required for meaningful education. ",Rebuttal
"This is based in fallacy, however, because those principles are developed through structured education, which cannot be found in stay-at-home schooling. ",Rebuttal
"However, this can cause issue for the kids who have no way to attended school or cannot attend school due to health issues or personal issues",Rebuttal
sometimes you'll need a buddy to help out or you'll need a teacher to ask questions to learn but people may take online courses because they feel that they can work better alone rather than to be working with others and thats where they could be in the wrong. ,Rebuttal
"But, they would then forfeit the opportunity to build relationships with other kids of their own age. Especially with younger kids and kids who like to stay at home or be alone, learning and building social skills starts at school.",Rebuttal
"This is a valid observation. But without the constant droning of a teacher to be on task, kids who are distantly educated are more likely to become distracted and it's displayed in their meager and unsatisfactory work. Distractions don't cease to exist in a classroom setting, but they are heavily reduced compared to when a student is at home. ",Rebuttal
"However, these circumstances aren't always applicable to the students who choose distance learning. And those students, who have no other reason other than they ""just want to stay home"" or ""don't feel like it"", should have to sit in a classroom with the rest of their peers, and learn like in the same setting and environment that everyone else does. For lazy students, distance education is not a valuable resource, and abused in order to waste time. ",Rebuttal
"While skyping does provide some interaction, learning through a screen will never provide students with the same student-teacher bond that is necessary for building mentor-type relationships in the future. ",Rebuttal
"However, the social route may not be ideal for some students. Most students suffer from social anxiety which could hidner them from focusing on their classwork. ",Rebuttal
those are small disadvantages for the huge advantages. ,Rebuttal
"Understandably, these points are legitimate, for the student could easily choose not to join the online conference to their class, for no teacher could force them to go to their next class.",Rebuttal
"However, the technology today of online and video conferences, such as Skype, can offer both auditory and visual interaction between the student and others.",Rebuttal
 but is not bad idea take the class,Rebuttal
"However, what if a child doesn't want these careers and strive for something more personal to them and just don't know it yet? ",Rebuttal
I argue that need to be aware of that their options are in order to branch out to do those things and schools give children that push to try out these new things and change them to their own liking. ,Rebuttal
"However, simply because something can be done, does not mean it should be.",Rebuttal
however that is completely false. ,Rebuttal
 but keep in mind that visual is harder than interacting. ,Rebuttal
"While this claim may be accurate in some cases, the majority of students that take online classes at home actually end up using their extra time very poorly. Students, again, tend to zone off fairly quickly with out structured direction ",Rebuttal
"Also, with this extra time students are given, they tend to use it to their own advantage rather then their educational advantage ",Rebuttal
" Nevertheless, look overs as an important point that student can ask questions to the teachers when they are not understand. When their friends can not help and do not know what to do students can ask the teacher for help ",Rebuttal
"Although, online students may receive more social interaction through chat rooms. ",Rebuttal
"but that is just not true. Students can not only get more time with there family, there family can also help them study and keep them on track. The students would be able to move at there own pace and not be rushed by a teacher. ",Rebuttal
"However, this is a non issue. Students taking online classes face the same requirements as their in-school classmates, just through a different medium.",Rebuttal
"However, students who learn at home all their life will suffer from a lack social skills, and will have a hard time fitting in in the real world.",Rebuttal
"However, it would be more beneficial if students take classes from home than go to school because there are more pros than cons in this situation",Rebuttal
Some students this way might not pay attention. Also they can use thier phone or do other stuff while the teacher is teaching and their grades could go down fast. ,Rebuttal
" Although this is a possibility, the thought that all students will take advantage of this program and slack off is toxic for the students.",Rebuttal
Although in school learning provides a more effective learning experience than online schooling ,Rebuttal
being able to listen in on class could help them have less work in school significantly.,Rebuttal
"however, distance learning would be able to get rid of additional school days due to weather and help a student stay on track when they need to miss school.",Rebuttal
"Online learning could also be implemented easily due to the fact that everyone has a chrome book in school, so many schools could install an app on the chrome book that allows for online learning to be possible.",Rebuttal
I think it would be a beneficial option to implement into the school systems in the long term. ,Rebuttal
"But this can easily be disputed, as various jobs are also shifting towards being heavily online. Being physically present is being phased out in almost every profession that doesn't need it in 2020. As for comprehension, digital technology is extremely versatile; it can be bent and modified to any extent that a person needs in order to be successful. ",Rebuttal
but I do't think so. ,Rebuttal
"Taking school classes at home will not benefit some people, though it can help those with different cases and should be available for those who need it.",Rebuttal
"This is actually incorrect as classes from home do the exact opposite in the grand scheme of life. Staying at home offers temporary satisfaction to those who do not like social interaction. But, in the long run those students are only hurting themselves as they are slowly being less acclimated to social interaction. The more exposure a student gets to socialization the more they build on those already existing social skills. Classes from home would only mess with those social skills. ",Rebuttal
however you don't necessarily get to see them everyday which can lead to not communicating to them and loosing the bond you have with that person.,Rebuttal
"however it helps students find clarity in the information they are presented with, which they are required to learn and know it. Its harder to learn over a screen and be able to retain the information that is just presented to you without explanation.",Rebuttal
"however, managing your time is such a helpful tool that will help you become a successful person not only in your academic life but also your work life when your older. With attending classes online could prevent you from learning how to manage your work and can significantly effect your mental health. ",Rebuttal
Students have the tendency to procrastinate and not do their work until the night before it is due.,Rebuttal
There are many ways to get around this such as giving the students school issued laptops for a year allowing them access any programs they may need at home. Also in the case has a school wide exam they can use their school building itself as a testing center for students. Although there are many opinions beside this one to consider. ,Rebuttal
"but in the world today, many new advances in technology offer better teaching styles and more time for students to compete homework.",Rebuttal
"it should not be what students rely on for their education.
",Rebuttal
"While online school does take away party from the personal experience you would get at a public school, online school makes up for that with video conferencing and direct communication with the teacher and other students.",Rebuttal
"That statement is false, most students that take the online courses do this so they can work at their own pace and learn things not offered by his or her public school. ",Rebuttal
"While this may be true, why hinder a young mind's education just to save a little bit of money? ",Rebuttal
; there are many cases where large classrooms actually cripple a student's potential ,Rebuttal
" but, these student's usually meet outside of school since they live close by. ",Rebuttal
however these conditions rarely become bad enough to take out power sources.,Rebuttal
Some people need distract and also need socialism with friends,Rebuttal
"however, I believe that is wrong because some students would take advantage of that opportunity",Rebuttal
"Sometimes for those children, who have been suffering in silence, enough is enough.
",Rebuttal
"Learning from home will not support these skills nearly as much as they need to be. It is also important to learn how to access these skills when stressed, so the little stress a student endures at school is actually beneficial to them. ",Rebuttal
"However, those students would still be able to attend a regular, tangible school or they could use guide books for each class. ",Rebuttal
"however, they would have one essential piece missing from their skills and that is guidance passed down from one to another.",Rebuttal
But some other Student didn't want to be home school because they feel them self bored in home.,Rebuttal
"However, there still remains the case that students will become distracted too easily and will begin to focus on other things besides school ",Rebuttal
 students shouldn't depend on one because their won't always be someone there to guide them,Rebuttal
but i think the students learn more from being at school.,Rebuttal
"however, whether it be online or in person, stress is something you cannot escape.",Rebuttal
 but that statement is false because the ones who want to strive for the best and make better situations for themseves know how to manage their time properly and set goals for themselves in the future. There would be a drastic impact on students grades if they took online classes and would benefit in many different ways. ,Rebuttal
But learning at home is better than learning at school because it allows the student to work at their own pace,Rebuttal
 those kids' learning experiences are not as successful as those who attend a physical school.,Rebuttal
"these services will be able to transition online. Lunches can be delivered, libraries can offer e-books online, and counselors are just an email away ",Rebuttal
"Therefore, students benefit from being able to attend classes at home, ",Rebuttal
but sometimes even reading the directions students get confused. ,Rebuttal
"These cases, however, are few and far between. The vast majority of students are perfectly capable of attending all of their classes, and allowing them to do otherwise only detracts from their learning experiences. ",Rebuttal
"However, people who don't even go to high school or college can still use the Testout service and use the same resources and get the same information as I get in my class. ",Rebuttal
"Though this is true, it is important to take into account that the world around us is changing.",Rebuttal
"but, every action has a risk and the same situation happens in school everyday, so, it just depends on the person and how committed they are to doing well in school, getting good grades, and staying on task.",Rebuttal
The only difference with online school is that instead of being physically in the school and doing the work. The student is at home completing the tasks instead. Online school should be offered for students who might want a change. ,Rebuttal
"The fact that my friend was taking Musical Theatre from home goes to show that, even for a class so dependent on the presence of other people, students can still perform well while learning a majority of the curriculum in someplace other than a classroom (or, in the case of a Musical Theatre class, a black box).
",Rebuttal
"I may find it difficult to keep up with lectures or notes, because of distracting friends, cold classrooms, and the inability to go to the bathroom whenever I want. Sometimes I need more time to process the topic for the day, or I may need to relearn the material in a room where I can adjust the thermostat. These are all benefits of learning at home!
",Rebuttal
"I would rather be around friends, than by myself. ",Rebuttal
when talking about this stuff you need think logical but in end it all add up to everyone else discussion. ,Rebuttal
" but many students benefit students greatly.
",Rebuttal
in reality online classes can help students in many more different ways. ,Rebuttal
online students find themselves struggling to understand what is being taught to them at least 50% of the time.,Rebuttal
"but because the quality of education goes down so greatly with distance learning, the cons far outweigh the pros.",Rebuttal
that could be easily overruled by the fact that we can easily make a new classroom in our current schools that offer extra help to impaired students. ,Rebuttal
"when in reality, online classes teach the exact same thing! ",Rebuttal
I know that a few students to prefer study in online but i know that not to be the same because only would be watch the computer. ,Rebuttal
" but in all honestly, almost anyone can get atleast something out of online schooling ",Rebuttal
then online web is the tools for study we have that permit us to share with others what is really going on inside our minds and hearts .they are the only intruments that reveal whether speaks and writes ,Rebuttal
but online school would not be adapted without complication.,Rebuttal
"would be nothing shy of disruptive, disorganized, and complicating to the systems currently in place.",Rebuttal
but in the program the my school to much student don't like the class online because not have teacher to explain the class or the work they need better to look the person to real for ask the question at have the problem for homework. ,Rebuttal
"in order for a student to fully develop into a successful person you have to have, social skills, community awareness, and be able to understand eye-to-eye learning ",Rebuttal
"the truth is that teachers are required to spend time in class as well as their personal time to do this in addition to supervising the class; working outside of school for no extra income could be a disincentive for teachers, resulting in inadequate monitoring.",Rebuttal
"but what these people fail to realize is that technology is equally, if not more, interactive than the assignments provided in the classroom. Since most of these assignments have already been digitized, the working environment should not be of a concern as long as the assigned tasks have been completed",Rebuttal
"but teachers have already begun combatting this issue with newer programs that deny access to any other sites and that monitor the student's activity throughout. The only limitation to DL that may detract from its success is the students' access to electronic devices; while LCPS provides their students with personal devices throughout the school year, other school systems may not have sufficient funding to do the same",Rebuttal
"I do believe that the ""one-on-one"" time a child will receive is extremely beneficial. The student will not have to worry about being left behind or being confused. They will have the time to understand while working at their own pace. Allowing the student to have a peace of mind, not worrying or struggling in school. ",Rebuttal
"Online classes can make eliminate distractions making it easier to focus, give students more opportunities to get help form teachers, and help out those who may be sick travel when there are important things going on.",Rebuttal
"but when it comes to getting work done, there are too many distractions that home provides for distance learning.
",Rebuttal
"While home school give students the opportunity to work at their own pace and complete assignments with their best effort, regular school however provides tools to do the same thing (after school, study hall, and teacher assistance). ",Rebuttal
but that's not true. ,Rebuttal
"Unfortunately, that isn't the case",Rebuttal
but I also get my work done because I know how to muti-task. But some students cant do that. ,Rebuttal
"However, if you're stuck on your work and your not in a video call with your professor, then how are you supposed to get the answer, and looking on the internet for the answer is not the most trustworthy thing to do. ",Rebuttal
"which is totally understandable, but the circumstances of the benefits from taking online or traditional classes still apply. ",Rebuttal
"However, those individuals tend to throw off the potential downfalls and only look at the few benefits that exist. ",Rebuttal
but they would be lacking in human skills ,Rebuttal
but it's a one on one class.,Rebuttal
"but I can show you otherwise with three reasons, starting with transportation.",Rebuttal
"This is not warranted because the effect is the opposite. Working from home allows students to take the time they need to get work done for the day in their own time, and then spend the remainder with friends or doing other activities. Students actually have more free time because they aren't as distracted. As long as they are participating in plenty of activities, and are getting out in the world to talk with others, teens will not become antisocial, lonely or depressed.
",Rebuttal
but they have others choses like school in the night or after school. ,Rebuttal
"While this may seem like a positive at first, learning from anywhere in the world is actually very detrimental. People tend to be more productive when they have a specific place to work (for example, a school) and a specific place to relax and enjoy (for example, a home). ",Rebuttal
" Althought this might be valid,There is several ideas to considered such as, Students would not be able to experience of being part of a club or sport in school.",Rebuttal
"However, most forms of distance learning, like online classes, do not account for an individual's needs nor the distinct types of learners and how what may work for one student will not work for another. ",Rebuttal
it should be know that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home .,Rebuttal
"Students would be able to benefit from attending classes from home because , different people from around the world can , it prevents bullies , and also prevents colds. Additionally students would benefit from attending classes from home because they learn time management plus responabilty , can make their own schedule and can get a head start into the real world,

and learn to be self dependent",Rebuttal
 but I disagree very much with such thoughts.,Rebuttal
"but I think the majority can admit that they have had an amazing friend come into their life through going to school, and I think every child deserve to have that one special friendship. ",Rebuttal
"but only for the students that have the technology at home, leaving the other students forced to do these projects by themselves. This will not only make cooperation on classwork limited to a few students, but also make the ones that do not possess the technology required feel less than.",Rebuttal
however that would only work if these students could somehow get to the same location putting a strain on parents to make that happen. It could possibly bring stress to a lot of families; whereas if classes were actually at school this stress could easily be avoided. ,Rebuttal
but many high school students and their families would feel a lot more at ease knowing that they are not alone but surrounded by adults and also friends. ,Rebuttal
the harsh realities of the every day student would not make it easier on them.,Rebuttal
Well I am here to tell you that they are still wrong. ,Rebuttal
but how would that help them in the much harsher adult would.,Rebuttal
"If I took at-home-classes, my social skills would've been a lot worse than they are today. The enviorment that is provide at schools is something everyone should have to experience. ",Rebuttal
"Yes, they could just be provided videos of experiments and uses an online calculator for math, but most students learn better with hands-on-experiences. That solution would just be subjecting them to a less effective form of education. ",Rebuttal
But most of them are not going to take care them self because there are not focusing the way. They just focusing what there are doing or they just focusing online or video.,Rebuttal
distance learning is not worth the risk for the majority of students.,Rebuttal
" With the ability to modify their own environment, students can create their own spaces that allow them to concentrate on their studies with ease. ",Rebuttal
"The entire purpose behind having the choice is to learn from mistakes. If no mistakes were made, then no one could improve. Online classing allows students to learn what to do in a safe and open environment. Without that chance, students would make the same mistakes in more important matters, and harm their well being later in life. ",Rebuttal
The beauty behind this whole process is that online classes don't eliminate the ability to have face to face classroom interactions that students have today. ,Rebuttal
"There are benefits to taking home classes, but it can be non-beneficial ",Rebuttal
"Despite these reasons, I still support online schooling because it provides us free time, time away from teachers, and freedom from restrictions and rules. ",Rebuttal
"however, that is not the same as having someone help you in person.",Rebuttal
"but, as previously mentioned, there are many unintentional side effects that hurt students.",Rebuttal
however there are also downsides such as more distractions and less one on one time with teachers.,Rebuttal
"However, teachers are not going to stop teaching their class for a day so that one student that was sick can catch up on their work. Students who can not concentrate in classrooms would learn more if they were signed up for distance learning than if they stayed in a classroom where they could not concentrate. This can be helpful for many students if their school participated in it. ",Rebuttal
but this is wrong to do.,Rebuttal
" but you still feel connected, inspired or inspire others online. Just because it's online doesn't mean you lose any sense of human interaction.",Rebuttal
When actually it could prevent you make the right choice.,Rebuttal
but not as critical as it is for bigger things. ,Rebuttal
Getting advice from certain people may expand your choices.,Rebuttal
it may not be a good idea to ask only one person for help. ,Rebuttal
"This way of thinking is flawed. In most cases, the person will actually gain a sense of understanding about the topic and acquire new knowledge, allowing them to make an informed and thoughtful decision. ",Rebuttal
" Although this is true, sharing several opinions can help benefit people in making the best decision.",Rebuttal
Not all decisions can be made alone someone needs help at some point. ,Rebuttal
This is incorrect because a persons opinion is based on what other people say or do.,Rebuttal
"However, not everyone will do this, ",Rebuttal
But also it could be the better choice of the 2 or more open options.,Rebuttal
"at least give it a try you might just change your mind.
",Rebuttal
But thats not necessarily true. ,Rebuttal
You could start off by picking your favorite advises and asking people which one is the best out of all of them. Dont stress about it even is its confusing you ,Rebuttal
"but if a lot of people are saying the same thing, think about it ",Rebuttal
 Never fear thats why the internet is here!,Rebuttal
" Although, I believe that multiple opinions can help you make a better choice",Rebuttal
Another way you can benefit from asking many people's advice is because it helps avoid bias,Rebuttal
it can also change your life for the better.,Rebuttal
. In this situation you have to look at the pros and cons to the subject or to what they told you for their opinion or advice.,Rebuttal
but you can always learn from those mistakes,Rebuttal
even if some people see it that way its not it will be stressful and a lot pressure but nothing in life is simple and you'll never know if having multiple opinions from people will make you feel relive and it will give you the best opportunity to make the better choice.              ,Rebuttal
 putting them into thoughtful consideration can help them view the situation in many diverse ways,Rebuttal
putting those options into deep consideration can allow a person to better understand what they are trying to accomplish with the choice in which they are trying to make.,Rebuttal
Even though that one person did give them advice to better there choice it's always good to have multiple opinions. How will it hurt to ask just a few more people? It WONT!!,Rebuttal
 That's why it's always important to always make sure you have your opinion invloved and not just someone elses opinion.,Rebuttal
most advice is good. ,Rebuttal
"Even with all this knowledge that failure is possible you still have to try, because your family is very likely to help you out if you ask even if they have little to no experience on the topic. There are people experienced in specific fields as well which can be very helpful depending on the situation such as; if your father was an english major in colleage he can help you out if you need it ",Rebuttal
 Sometimes it can really help for example when you get the information back and it is different then it can make you think more about what to do in that situation and what you can do to make things easier on yourself.,Rebuttal
but asking for others advice is a good way to solve something if your having trouble with something. ,Rebuttal
most people asking for advice have open minds and are willing to listen to different thoughts.,Rebuttal
"Nonetheless, asking for others opinions can still help us understand their side of the topic, and quite possibly what they know that we don't.",Rebuttal
Different opinions and different advice work for different people.,Rebuttal
its always good to hear others opinions.,Rebuttal
"On the contrary, I feel that asking others for advice is a great idea. ",Rebuttal
But this is incorrect.,Rebuttal
There is always a happy medium. If you only ask one person then you wont be prepared enough and if you ask to many people then you might never be able to do what you set out to do. ,Rebuttal
"My opinion is to talk to multiple people, ",Rebuttal
 sometimes even the hardest ones to agree with can be helpful ,Rebuttal
 You can listen to everyone's ideas and insights and narrow your options down to what is best for you,Rebuttal
"There are some people to trust and others to not trust.
",Rebuttal
but it really does help,Rebuttal
in experience receiving advice from more than one person has helped me a lot.,Rebuttal
I find that no where near embarrassing because you should not feel that way at all. You need to be comfortable at all times and always listen to what the other person has to say.,Rebuttal
"When in fact, it's best to get multiple sources. No one piece of information is the greatest.",Rebuttal
" It is important to keep in mind, however, that the advice given still may not be the best, and to get the best advice possible, you will have to consult multiple people. ",Rebuttal
Just keep in mind that advice from different people is very helpful.,Rebuttal
"but if you limit how many people you ask and ask them each a different question, than you can focus on those answers instead of a bunch of overloading advice",Rebuttal
"However, getting multiple views on a decision is always the best option, because everyone sees things differently. ",Rebuttal
a study here proves that there is a correlation between those two. A 2020 study from the Oxford Social Interaction Service stated that asking for help or an opinion makes people interact better.,Rebuttal
"Although I feel I need to clarify why we need advice in general. Advice is mainly helpful for learning, also it can help those who don't see what they should do, ",Rebuttal
You realize that you can't make a lot of decisions on your own without help from others.,Rebuttal
but this can lead to many difficult positions.,Rebuttal
" But chances are that if the person asking got a good and reliable answer, the person they asked is smarter than the person asking. ",Rebuttal
However that is not true because it helps make your choice a lot easier by finding out what others have to say. Finding out what other people have to say is only helpful if you let it influence your choice.,Rebuttal
 but when you need advice do you just want that person or alot of people giving you advice. ,Rebuttal
but it's actually a good thing sometimes it's more helpful then others think ,Rebuttal
but sometimes we do need the people we trust and ask them for the advice or opinion we need and when one is not enough we go to another to get the right amount we want or need to be satisfact with ourselves,Rebuttal
"but there is times when we will need them, and it will be helpful.",Rebuttal
"Although so many thoughts and opinions may stall your thought process it may speed it up too. With multiple peoples thought and feedback, you may begin to see a pattern. With that pattern it may show you which path to follow in finding the best choice for yourself, which may come a lot faster than you would expect. ",Rebuttal
but in the end it helps you more than it hurts you.,Rebuttal
"I understand all of that but, seeking attention with someone you know is gonna help",Rebuttal
"but you don't need to completely dismiss the idea instead you can let them finish voicing the idea then give your own spin to it.
",Rebuttal
" That may help, but it will never be as effective as asking multiple people for guidance.",Rebuttal
But there are right but in a wrong way. Trusting yourself can lead into a worse situation to get your self out or a good way and if you cant make a decision you will have depression for the rest of your life. ,Rebuttal
Maybe you will have enough common since to no not to do it because there are many bad things that can happen to you. ,Rebuttal
" It does not work that way, what if the person gives you a bad idea? it just results you in getting in trouble with school, with your parents, with your job, and just even the real world. You could do something stupid and go to jail for it because someone told you it was a good idea ",Rebuttal
" Yet, no one knows you better than you know yourself. It is scientifically proven that no one knows you better then you know yourself. About 65% of people go to others about their problems.",Rebuttal
"but, I think its better to have other opinions because you can find new view points, you can have a outsiders opinion and you can discover more useful information that is relevant to the topic.",Rebuttal
"To that I would say their are more people than you think who have gone through what you have, but they may have not told many people yet. So when you have a situation, seeking others opinions is a great way to get multiple peoples advice.",Rebuttal
"sometimes you have to accept the fact that other people have more wisdom or knowledge than your and they would know what the best course of action is. Also people who have already been in this situation know about it, and you need to ask them for advice, not just wing it and go with what your gut tells you.",Rebuttal
but your parents and sisters know what is good for you as well. That is why if you dont know weather to get one thing or another thing and you like both of them.,Rebuttal
"Well, imagine how much better it would be to look at your situations from different angles. Wouldn't that be pretty nice? ",Rebuttal
Those are the people you dont listen to. They will bring you down and lead you to failure. You have to just ignore all of that and not take all of the negativity in. ,Rebuttal
"but sometimes could be good intel on some other things you'd probably need to know like life standards, what to eat so you can get better, and what can make you better. ",Rebuttal
But the solution to that is by taking bits of each piece of advice and complete the puzzle ,Rebuttal
you just cant be completely idiotic about it that is what i am saying.,Rebuttal
But its a better idea to ask two because now there is another side to just that one earlier. ,Rebuttal
"But there is also a problem when asking only one person. If you truly trust that person, but they don't give you good advice who are you gonna ask then. The only person you told your problem to was that one person, so you don't have multiple choices like when you ask multiple people.",Rebuttal
" If you also ask one people and it gets to an adult, then you would have to explain your problem to them even if you didn't want to. Then word would get around that you snitched to a teacher and then thats how bulling starts ",Rebuttal
but I don't like to listen to the people who disagree with my reasons. ,Rebuttal
 what are the odds that seven of your close friends do not no what you are talking about? ,Rebuttal
