"There are some exceptions to talking on the phone and driving such as having speaking on the phone and connecting it to the car via, bluetooth ",Counterclaim
"A lot of excuses for people are ""oh, i can multitask"" or ""i know what i'm doing"" ",Counterclaim
One argument against the use of phones in vehicles is that they encourage distracted and dangerous driving. ,Counterclaim

This is a common argument habitual cell phone users make. They say that they will be able to report an emergency or accident faster if they have their cell phones already in their hands, ",Counterclaim
"Another argument made is, ""I was at a stoplight!"" (Schule, 5). This is one of the most common excuses made by drivers caught using their phones. They believe if they're stopped that they aren't a danger,",Counterclaim

 People might think it isn't a big deal to drive while on the phone,Counterclaim
 I understand emergencies happen and you need your phone,Counterclaim
I do believe that people should be allowed to make phone calls via voice,Counterclaim
On the other hand some people in the world are going to have to use their phones as a job.,Counterclaim

And being a car lover i wouldnt want to see cars go but i think a change to electric would fine and helpful. ",Counterclaim
Basically what im trying to get across here is that all cars do is make us get to work faster ,Counterclaim
What about if it was raining how are we suppsoed to get to work or get food. we need a car to get to places. ,Counterclaim
But i think it has stopped them. Therefore we need are cars to get to where we need to be.      ,Counterclaim
"Eventhough cars cause greenhouse gas, air polution and death they are also very help full because if you have to go late at night to get food you have a fast way to get to the market because u have a car right out side your door.

"I know, it seems pretty bizare due to the fact that some towns, such as my own, do not have everything citizens need within a walking distance.",Counterclaim

Cars are the most affordable means of automatic transportation it really is hard to the habit you have already forged over a century ago,Counterclaim

Many believe that having a car makes life more convenient.,Counterclaim
"Many believe a car is very convenient due to the fact that it can get you where you want to go in a small amount of time which, in fact, could be very useful for special occasions. ",Counterclaim
Limiting car usage would not be good for few citizens. Some citizens are just plain lazy and have no sense of being active. ,Counterclaim

Even though a no car program can be a huge benefit there are still people disagreeing.,Counterclaim
Some may claim an agrument of cars being very useful and it helps get from destination to destination in a resonable amount of time ,Counterclaim
yeah people praise cars just because they are lazy and like using cars to get places faster,Counterclaim
The main dis advantage being that if you have to travel far you would have to use public transportation. ,Counterclaim
"Cars are best used for far traveling and can go much faster and carry more of a load when going on a 200 mile trip, I would not want to have a bike. ",Counterclaim

I also realize some places in the world this is not possible. there is many factors that go into this wether it be saftey reasons or if your like me everything is so spread out,Counterclaim
 but its also important to have a car.    ,Counterclaim
Sure by limiting the usage of cars would have an effect on people,Counterclaim
Our cars seem to be as important as one of our limbs. Something you could not bare to live without. ,Counterclaim

The End of Car Culture

cars are not the worst thing to have because it gets you from point a to point b,Counterclaim
"Many say that limiting the use of acars would prevent many from going to work, school and other obligagtions, ",Counterclaim
That last statement has to be coming from a liar because why would you ever be happy without a car? ,Counterclaim

Using a car can also be a benift.,Counterclaim

 it is true that people without cars would have to go through the rain or the cold weather every time the weather looks ominous and people would have to worry about getting to school or work on time. ,Counterclaim

If I started in the morning at lets just say 10am by the time I get there it would be like 2pm and if I go there and come right back I would be at high school at 7pm, not including the time I spent at the lake. What I'm trying to say that it takes so much time in the day and then just so exhausted by the time you get back.

Teachers could argue and say that it would only be a waste of time ,Counterclaim
 For students it may not be fun,Counterclaim
Some people may disagree due to others seeing it in different ways. Others may see the project as not interesting because the students should be able to do it the way they want to due to them having to do the object during the summer and it not being able to benefit them because the students can not look back on their mistakes.,Counterclaim
" Teacher-designed projects can also have students work with each other and promote the engagement with other students,",Counterclaim
Students-designed projects are interesting to give over the summer break.,Counterclaim
While being able to pick their own topic for a summer project may be more fun for students ,Counterclaim
Although teacher designed summer projects are a great way for students to learn about something related to school while their off school ,Counterclaim
Other people might argue that the students are also well informed about what they are being taught so should create their own summer projects,Counterclaim
if student-designed projects are used students are more likely to create very short and straight to the point projects because most students are lazy and just do not want to be bothered with any work so would not want to challenge themselves to research and do more but would want very few questions that would not need any serious thinking and application of knowledge.,Counterclaim
On the other hand teacher may feel that if they designed the projects that it will be better for students and they also may feel that overly challenging students is a good thing because it put students in a position to challenge themselves and to learn at a higher level;,Counterclaim
Some students may think that a student-designed assignment would be easier and more beneficial.,Counterclaim
 students would have fun inventing their own requirements for the assignment,Counterclaim
some may disagree with this viewpoint. Some may say that designing their own projects provides students with an opportunity to pick an easy topic with which they will not be challenged.,Counterclaim
"If it were a teacher-designed project, most students wouldnt participate.",Counterclaim
Some might say that students can prepare themselves better for the school year than the teacher can. They don't need to have the teacher to assign them work.,Counterclaim

Some say that teacher-designed projects are better because teachers are more experienced and know what's better for the students ,Counterclaim
"Some people may believe that allowing students to design their own projects creates more work for teachers, putting stress on them. The teachers cannot have a uniform grading rubric and must have enough background knowledge on each student's topic in order to grade them fairly.",Counterclaim
"This would in return create a bias with the teacher.
",Counterclaim
"Now there is a very great con to my argument. That con my friend has a name, and her name is, bias. With going with the plan on doing said project create a very huge bias within teachers. ",Counterclaim
"Although students might think making school projects student-designed is a good idea, teachers might not agree. Some students could take this their advantage, by making the project as simple and pointless as they want.

Others may that teacher designed projects are better because they force ever student to work,Counterclaim
Others say that student designed projects dont push students enough to really create a product worthwhile;,Counterclaim
"However, some teachers might argue that allowing the students to design their summer project wouldn't be an excellent idea. Teachers may say that students would give no effort because they do have lead way on their project or it may be overwhelming for the student to make a decision on what they wanted their topic to be ",Counterclaim
"Some people might argue that the teachers are more knowledgeable about what the students should be learning about. That without the teacher's directions, the students will get off task. ",Counterclaim
Some might say the students aren't going to know what information to learn and use in the project. If teachers work with students they can figure out a way to make sure that they students learn all the information they need to.,Counterclaim
 While some agree with this others are concered that students would make the project too easy. ,Counterclaim
While doing a project with family members might distract students from learning,Counterclaim
some students may have trouble designing projects themselves.,Counterclaim
working on a project while on summer break may be hard if you got to think of it all by yourself. But not only will you have to think for your self you will have to think about how the teacher actually want this project done.,Counterclaim
Some believe that it is more important for teachers to assign projects to students,Counterclaim
" Others may argue that with more freedom, a student might not stick to what they what they are supposed to learn",Counterclaim
"One can argue that this is not a good idea for students on choosing their project one reason one could say is that it may lack focus ,that this curtain thing wont help them in life, and that they need to know more important things in school",Counterclaim

"If students got to pick their own topics, maybe they would feel inspired and put in more effort,",Counterclaim
"A couple of main arguments that may arise when students get to make their own summer projects is that they may not be learning about what they should be learning about or the project is not regulated enough itself to provide any academic goals. Or, a student may make a project that is overall not fitted for any academic setting. ",Counterclaim
"Although, some students are proven to be less responsible than others,",Counterclaim
Some people might say that a student can be motivated to complete a project even if it is teacher-designed. ,Counterclaim
I get it teachers want students to have summer assignments so that they're still learning ,Counterclaim
"Although, student should have a say in the subject, length, and platform of their summer projects, teachers should also set boundaries for these projects.",Counterclaim
"a teacher designed project would set standards of the project and can help students complete it, and it can be easy to know the rules of making the project.",Counterclaim

student-designed projects entail open exploration of a plethora of topics.,Counterclaim

"While some may say that teacher designed projects over the summer time are better,",Counterclaim
Some could argue that teacher designed projects are better due to them being more structured and proper,Counterclaim
"Although students coming up with their own assignments to do for the summer project would increase their learning abilities, have trouble thinking of their own project and how they're going to make it. Not only that but teachers assigning the project to their students would be a bit easier than students having to look up a topic and figure out what to do on their own ",Counterclaim
There are some drawbacks to the TDSP however. The first reason would be it might put more stress on the students in a time where we are supposed to be relaxing from school work to take time for ourselves.,Counterclaim
"The second drawback is that it would put more strain on the school system to pay certain TDSP teachers through the summer, and it would also take precious summer time away from those said TDSP teachers.",Counterclaim
"The third drawback would be that it is catered towards people who are somewhat lazy, restricting the students that are not to a bound path. ",Counterclaim
"However, some people might prefer having a teacher-designed project over a student-designed project, because it tells them exactly what to do and how to do it. I ",Counterclaim

Although some may believe otherwise ,Counterclaim
Others could say that without direction students wouldn't know what to do ,Counterclaim
"Some opposed to this may say, ""I do not want to do a summer project anyways, therefore let me choose the topic"". I agree that the topic of the project may be more interesting if it is student-designed, ",Counterclaim
Some may argue that students could design the summer projects so they require minimum effort since they want to complete their projects as quickly as possible. ,Counterclaim
"Some might say that isn't the case, because students might not take the project as seriously as they would if it was designed by a teacher ",Counterclaim
"On the flip side teachers did go to college for, four plus years and have been in this profession for even longer, so that is a great factor onto why most summer projects are teacher designed and so pressing on certain subjects. It's not supposed to be hard, the teachers just want he best for you, and have to teach you the schematics for next year or for life. It's similar to parenting, sometimes you have to be harsh to get the point through and the point is to get that student to be well rounded before he/she leaves high school. All the Teachers want to see is the students being successful and confident in everything they do to better on their lives. In short they want us to succeed to better on our lives; which is selfless and much appreciated.
",Counterclaim
" teachers are no joke though as they work day and night to give us students the best education possible, it's stressful being a teacher and in our eyes a worthy sacrifice.

Grading papers form 150 students and also having to stay on track and give out more papers is a hassle; thats why we have teacher aide's to help them get through the day which is selfless and deserves recognition",Counterclaim
"Some, especially teachers, might argue that having students design their own summer projects will lead to the minimal work necessary and a poorly done assignment.

The only reason I feel like would be a better idea if the students designed the project is because it gives more creativity for the students.,Counterclaim
Some people say that student-designed projects can get you thinking or you can be creative. ,Counterclaim
"many people worry that if students are allowed to create their own projects then they would be completely pointless, or have no benefit.",Counterclaim
Students projects should be teacher designed to many students because teachers can choose project's they choose for their class and teachers can decide how tough they should be. ,Counterclaim
Some may say that students are lazy and if they were to have control over their own summer projects they will produce easy projects that will not prepare them for the upcoming year. Since this generation have students who have access to devices that makes life too easy for them.,Counterclaim
"People can still argue that teacher-designed projects are more successful. While it is true that if teachers designed the projects, every student will at least have something to work on ",Counterclaim
"if the projects were to be student design, there could be benefits to it. There would be lots of room for creativity and originality. The students might have a better sense of freedom on the projects and it could possibly make them work better. Also, being able to design it themselves could instill a greater passion for working on the project. The possibility of being original with the project design could also lead to a better assurance that the students will still learn over the summer.",Counterclaim
Some argue that a student would be more inclined to do their project if they got to design it.,Counterclaim
 It is easy to assume students would try to make the project easier on themselves ,Counterclaim
"Even though it would be fun and creative for students to have a part in designing their own summer projects,",Counterclaim
On the other hand I can see how people could have an argument for why kids designing their own summer projects could be a good thing. Students know what goes on in their minds and what certain work they need to address specific issues.,Counterclaim
"In addition studets designing their own projects could mean less backlash for the schools incase parents get mad about summer projects being too hard, because the students in that school designed that project not the teachers.",Counterclaim

"Some may argue that this would enable students to pick topics not related to anything in school,",Counterclaim
"The opposite side would argue that this would enable students to procrastinate on work, and not put in enough effort into the project ",Counterclaim
"Even though the projects assigned to students may be easy, some may complain about the subject and want to do a project on a subject they choose.

While some students may prefer to do a summer project on what they want. The pros to this would be that they are actually interested in the subject and more motivated about it. They would also, most likely get a better grade on something they are genuinely concerned about. For example, if a student loved the ocean, they would be more excited doing a project on marine life or how unique the ocean is than doing a project about different rocks.",Counterclaim
some people may argue that a teacher-designed project would be better because it keep students from doing a project that is too easy or a project that makes no sense.,Counterclaim
"The biggest downside to students picking their own topic is that teachers grading summer projects or presentation may not understand the work or topic from a project the student has dedicated the summer to.

"The project that the teachers would make, can be boring and students do not want to have a summer project to ruin their summer break",Counterclaim
Some teacher may argue and say that a teacher-designed project may be better ,Counterclaim
It would not be a good decision to let students design and control their own summer projects or assignments because it is important students are learning the correct material necessary for class. It would be pointless for students to complete a summer assignment or project if it was not based on the school's curriculum ,Counterclaim
It could be argued that if students made their own projects they would make it easy that it wouldnt take any time for them to finish it.,Counterclaim
"there are some benefits to doing a teacher-designed project rather than a student-designed one. For one thing, rules and guidelines would most likely be very clear.",Counterclaim
People who support student-designed summer assignments may argue that advanced placement (AP) classes require students to learn from textbooks without the guidance of a teacher so students do not need teacher guidance.,Counterclaim
Some may that student design is better due to boosting tier moral and letting the project being something they can enjoy ,Counterclaim
While other people might say that these summer projects should be teacher designed because the student keep learning more and keep working hard;,Counterclaim

Although some may say teachers are more experienced at giving projects because they have been doing it longer ,Counterclaim
Summer project's should be assigned by teacher's and not student's because of the lack effort the student's will put forth.,Counterclaim
"The effort given in a teacher-designed assignment versus a student-designed assignment would be completely different. You're likely thinking a student won't do their work if it was up to them and not the teacher,",Counterclaim

Some may argue that students would not be responsible enough to plan and execute the summer project.,Counterclaim
"One might be thinking at this point, ""Come on now. This is great for all the kids who are motivated to learn and are enough of a go-getter to go out and do this stuff, but what about the ones who just want to sit inside and play video games or hang out with their friends?""",Counterclaim
People might argue that the students should have their own choice as to what they create it on. ,Counterclaim
"An increasingly common assumption is that pscyhological intuition, and creativity in some aspects, increases with age, thus students are less capable of designing a project, or most things for that matter, than adults. Several people argue that students may lack maturity,",Counterclaim
"Adding to that, and perhaps one of the most common arguments against teacher-designed projects, is the statement that students are not exposed to projects that require overarching critical thinking",Counterclaim
Now I know some people think teacher designed summer projects are more direct and easy to follow,Counterclaim

Some people might not agree and say an assignment is an assignment it has to get done regardless.,Counterclaim
"Few may argue that students cannot be trusted in designing a project that is relevant to the curriculum and that allows for students to learn at the same time. Furthermore, students may be inclined to design a project that is too simple for them.",Counterclaim
 Few may also argue that allowing the students to design their summer projects would result in mad time management since students would also control when certain tasks may need to be completed. ,Counterclaim
Letting students design their summer projects could be an extravagant opportunity because students would have an opportunity to be creative,Counterclaim
"Although they may concede some of my points, supporters of students designing their own summer projects might argue that if the teachers were to design the summer projects of students, then the students would likely care little for the topic chosen and put little effort into their projects. They would argue that students should design their own projects because they would be enthusiastic and excited to learn about something that they chose that interests them ",Counterclaim
Having a teacher assigned project does have an upside,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, some people do believe student-designed summer projects would be more beneficial. This is because it could teach a student how to be responsible or learn on their own.",Counterclaim
on the other hand teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to students because the content created by teachers is consistent with the content learned during the school year. ,Counterclaim
"In contrast to student-designed projects, teacher designed projects also have a positive impact on students because of their ability to create content which is consistent with the content students learn during the school year. Thinking outside the box and being able to express ideas is very important, however, without teachers, students would have no path of what to learn and how to learn it because they do not have the experience and accumulated knowledge many teachers have. Teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to the students ability to learn during the summer because the content would be structured in way which is taught during the school year. An example of this is when a science teacher assigns a cell packet project which corresponds to the cell unit taught during school. This might be very boring for a student to learn, but doing this project will set the student up for success when school begins. If the student were to design their own project it would probably not be in line with the certain style of teaching which will cause the student to struggle during the school year. The main focus of teachers is to help students succeed in school and by designing these projects students will be able on the correct path to fulfilling that goal.

"Some people argue that student-designed projects would not be beneficial because students would have trouble trying to come up with a good idea for their project.

"Although guidelines are arguably necessary to any graded assignment,",Counterclaim
Some may argue that teacher designed summer projects give students a chance to broaden and strengthen skills students are uncomfortable with,Counterclaim

Student designed projects could be great since they can make how difficult it is for them ,Counterclaim
"I understand that some projects need to be designed by the students.

Teacher may want to have them design them because they think students would make it extremely easy which is fair. ,Counterclaim
Teachers are more experienced. With people that think that teachers are the best option for designing the project I do understand why. Students are young and may just want to take the easy route by not putting much effort into it. ,Counterclaim

"Some people however, may believe the students would not complete the projects if it was student-designed. If the students did not know what to choose for their projects they may not even bother to do it.",Counterclaim
 allowing students to think of their own prodjects would be a good idea is because it allows you to see exactly how creative they can be if they used their own thoughts and imagination. Because yeah teachers can think of something quick and easy for you to do for the prodject but that doesn't show how creative that student really can be. You never know what type of fun things they can put together for the prodject they could always think of something the teacher would have never thought about and really blow them out of the park with how good they did. This just shows them how responsible you are or can be when you're willing to do the work. Yes I know most kids don't want to be working on a prodject during the summer but if they was to just work and get the prodject over with that will give them the rest of the summer and they won't have to worry about finifhing up that prodject durign their break. ,Counterclaim

"Some may argue that it is the teacher job to prepare the students, and create summer assignments to reflect the year,",Counterclaim
Many teachers will argue that assigning a teacher-based project will assure that the students are learning what is required.,Counterclaim
"Although not encouraged, this freedom also gives students who procrastinate the ability to make their sleepless night completing said project the day before school starts less stressful",Counterclaim
Some might say that assignments students make up could be counterproductive since they might not have anything to do with themes or topics that will be learned in the coming school year. ,Counterclaim
Some teachers may argue that student-designed summer projects are an outlet for students to show their creativity. They believe that students can showcase their intellectual level by completing student-designed projects and the teachers can get a better understanding of their students' beliefs and preferences through student-designed projects,Counterclaim
Some people think summer projects should be teacher designed,Counterclaim
One may argue that self teaching is the best form of teaching. They would also agree That this project should be student-designed.,Counterclaim
"Although some believe that if the summer project is student-designed then they wont learn anything or grow,",Counterclaim
"Although, most teachers believes it is a bad idea for students to design they own project because they believe they will not take it seriously.",Counterclaim
"The idea of a student designing their own project is to give the student a little freedom. By allowing them to design it, teachers are able to see if students are capable of adding enough requirements based on what they've done on previous ones over the past years.",Counterclaim
 the teacher-designed project would be more organized.,Counterclaim
Some might argue that teachers have the right to choose a project topic so that it is related to the curriculum ,Counterclaim
"Some people may say that, teachers need to design the students projects so they need to know what to do so they don't get off track ",Counterclaim
Some people may say that just because you let students decide what they are goign to do with a project doesn't mean that they wont be depending on someone to help them in life ,Counterclaim
"However, teacher-designed projects are helpful too, they teach exactly what the teacher would teach them in class which gives learners an understanding of the content from the teachers perspective and could possibly give them knowledge on material they do not know.",Counterclaim
Some people may disagree with the argument that students know what they need better because they know themselves ,Counterclaim
"Although some may disagree, with retaliation on how a teacher can know everyone of their students on the basis of how the teacher has time or has the patience to do so,",Counterclaim
"The major opposing claim is that most students need opportunities to be creative,",Counterclaim
A popular proposition from the opposing side would be that students need certain opportunities to be creative,Counterclaim
Teacher's may argue that students will choose an easier route and not challenge themselves. They will also argue they worry that the students wont be creative.,Counterclaim
They may also fear that students might be inappropriate with their designs ,Counterclaim
Others may say that its fun for students to create their own project and have their own spin on it.,Counterclaim
"Of course, teachers and parents would say that having students design the project themelves is a bad idea as students will just make the project too easy",Counterclaim
" One of the downsides will be that not everyone will do the project because they either dont know what to do for the project or they are just lazy. Also during the summer people are traveling a lot so some kids cant complete the project, weather its because they just dont want to or they cant because of their location.",Counterclaim
Opponents wrongly believe summer projects should be student designed because students are more likely to do it and can be creative.,Counterclaim
The opposition incorrectly believes summer projects should be student designed because students will learn work ethic and possibly find hidden talents.,Counterclaim
"However, Students may still refrain from doing their projects. This is always true schools will always have some students who will not do their work especially summer projects.",Counterclaim
Some people may argue students will make their project super simple so they don't have to do that much work,Counterclaim
Some may say that a teacher designed project is better because it is a more structured assignment that has a more predictable end result,Counterclaim
Unfortunately an open ended project will allow some students to take the easiest possible route and create an underwhelming product ,Counterclaim
The other side incorrectly thinks that students need to design their own projects because it helps them with confidence in themselves and it will be satisfying because they finished something they created by themselves.,Counterclaim
Many people believe that teachers should design their students projects because kids or teenagers would forget the lesson ,Counterclaim
"Not everyone agrees with me, some people will say that a student designed project is more beneficial for the kids. They will argue, and say its summer the students should do their own project and do it in their own time.",Counterclaim
They might also argue that students dont want to be pestered about how teacher want the work to be and it is a time for a little freedom and they can do a fun project that they deigned all by them self. ,Counterclaim
" While one can argue that it would be easier for the teacher to give every student the same project topic since every project would be consistent and easier to grade,",Counterclaim
One can argue that having the teacher force them an assignment is teaching the students work with something they don't enjoy ,Counterclaim
"You could argue that having the student design their own projects allows them to have some discipline and order for how they spend their time,",Counterclaim
"Some may argue with this position some may argue that you should get to design your own project because its over your summer break and dont wanna do much work, so student-designed projects would be easier because they could make the project easy.",Counterclaim
Some might argue that making the projects challenging can give students a hard time.,Counterclaim
"Some people might say that projects are not educating, and that they are only given to students just to complete it.",Counterclaim
Some debate that the projects don't really come in use after the students complete it.,Counterclaim
"While teachers may have a broader understanding of the subject matter that their students will need to know and work on over summer,",Counterclaim
"An issue with student's choosing their assignment is that the topic could be unrelated or has no basis for education and will not teach the student adequate information,",Counterclaim
"The problem with teacher-based or a curriculum-style learning is that the student may feel overwhelmed by the speed of the course of the assignment and simply not do it, ",Counterclaim
Many students believe that they should be able to design their own summer projects because they feel like they should have a chance to assign themselves something that they are actually interested in,Counterclaim
"Maybe most teachers feel that if students really cared about learning and school, that it doesn't matter when the project is assigned to you, you should just do it. Also, teachers may think with all the time during the summer, students should have plenty of time to balance managing their summer fun with their summer projects. In some teachers head, I think they may be saying if you care enough to learn and keep your brain and mind focused during the break, doing the projects when they assign they should be no issue at all",Counterclaim
Although some say a student-designed assignment allows for more student creativity,Counterclaim
"While yes, teachers usually assign projects so a student does not go off topic,",Counterclaim
"While yes, the student can use online sources and copy information from that source ",Counterclaim
"Although some may say that students are more likely to do summer projects if they are the ones who get to design them, this is simply not true.",Counterclaim
"Some may say that teachers assign to much and that if students were to design the summer projects it would be better to fit into their summer schedules,",Counterclaim
"Now, on the other hand, some may say teachers should design the project. They may say teachers are experienced and know what's best for students. ",Counterclaim
"Some may also say teachers will give us a challenge and make sure we learn, while a student will just find the easiest route and go on it.",Counterclaim
"Some may say teacher designed projects will introduce the exact information needed for the upcoming course,",Counterclaim
there are those who say it would be more beneficial to make it the teachers' task to design them. ,Counterclaim
Teachers and adults may say that letting students choose their projects is out of line and a lot of extra work to grade.,Counterclaim
Some teachers may argue that their work is impossible to cheat on because of xyz or that if students don't work on something during the summer or they'll forget everything they learned. ,Counterclaim
Others may also argue that to a student school is the most important priority they have; so instead of working to help keep their family fed they should be reviewing algebra II.,Counterclaim
"Some may argue that student-designed projects allow students to have creativity, individuality, and freedom. As a result of these things, students would be more inclined to complete the project;",Counterclaim
"Some people say that teachers should design projects and assignments to keep order and have no chaos in the classroom,",Counterclaim
"Some might say that student-designed projects allow a more personalized and creative component. Additionally, students will be able to design a project they enjoy learning. ",Counterclaim
"A student-designed project may sound like a good idea because it opens up the opportunity for students to be creative and show what they know, ",Counterclaim
" While teacher designed projects can be more well planned for grading and more generalized,",Counterclaim
"Although doing a student designed project might be easier for the student,",Counterclaim
"Some people may say, that having the students design their own projects isn't a good idea because of the stable structure most teachers are able to implement more so then some students. ",Counterclaim
"teachers may disagree with these statements because they want projects that are easier to grade and go over. If a teacher is receiving over one hundred summer projects that were student-designed, he or she may feel overwhelmed and it may take a longer time to grade. All teachers teach differently, just like all students learn differently, so having teacher-designed projects for over the summer can be a simpler task for the teacher. Although teachers want students to learn over break by doing projects, I am sure they want a break too from grading papers and assignments or being flooded with them once school starts back up again. ",Counterclaim
"Teachers are more accustomed to creating things like this, so they would have a more knowledge on what is and is not important for a student to be creating and learning by themselves.",Counterclaim
Some may argue summer projects from teachers is good. This is because the teachers have more information about summer projects and they know what kind of projects is better for students.,Counterclaim
"Although, if you do design your own project you're responsible for everything to do with that project. Teacher's design projects to help you out and make sure that you don't go off track and stay with the assignment at hand.",Counterclaim
People might prefer a teacher-designed project,Counterclaim
People wouldn't like the idea of a student-designed project because students can't consult or get help from a teacher if they run into a problem ,Counterclaim
Teachers-designed projects would allow students to have a baseline of where to start from. One positive of teacher-designed projects would be they are professionally designed (by the Teacher). ,Counterclaim
some say that teacher-design is better and more effective,Counterclaim
"Most students would prefer to design the project themselves, ",Counterclaim
"However, if these projects were to be created by students, there would still be a beneficial yield. Students would receive a chance to demonstrate their knowledge of the material before the start of the year, and then measure their progress, all while having the freedom of choice to determine which topic they would like to research or work on.",Counterclaim
"While some people believe it's taking the freedom of choosing a topic,",Counterclaim
"The opposing idea of a student-designed project can be argued to be beneficial to the students for maybe 2 ways, it allows the student to be more creative and if they can design something they like... they will be more motivated to complete the task. ",Counterclaim
"Yes, students will have a lot of time to complete the work given from the teacher ",Counterclaim
"
Although teacher-designed summer project would be more academically challenging for the students, ",Counterclaim
 An argument that could be made against this is that my teacher loved what he was doing and thats why the class enjoyed history. ,Counterclaim
Yes this may just be a small few projects they do over the summer,Counterclaim
Some may argue that students know what works for them when it comes to learning,Counterclaim
"Although student-designed projects would be liked more by the student,",Counterclaim
"But a student-designed summer project lets the teacher see what kind of student are taking their class, their level of creativity, and what the teacher needs to cover. ",Counterclaim
But students may appreciate the projects teachers assign if they got to have a say in what the rubric is.,Counterclaim
"Although many people believe that teachers should create these summer projects because the students would know exactly what they need to learn or prepare for,",Counterclaim
"It might be easier for the teacher to grade or review,",Counterclaim
"Student-designed summer assignments can be reliable in some cases.

If you're a rising Senior in High School then you could use the opportunity to help prepare yourself for the future.

It would be a valuable learning experience that you could use in your life. ",Counterclaim
"although, teacher-designed projects tend to be most specific and direct, which directly gives students something to start with ",Counterclaim
" I understand they could be told in advance a topic that they'll be studying in the upcoming year and design their projects to be about that,",Counterclaim
"If the projects were student-designed they could design a project that is about their weak points to work on them..Also,if the students create the projects it showed how creative they are and how much they care about their education. They will also get the opportunity to create projects they'll enjoy doing and still get a good lesson from it. For example,Generic_Name designed his project on his game system now, he get to play the game and do his work at the same time. ",Counterclaim
"Although having a summer projected designed by a teacher would allow the teacher to grade the projects more efficiently as they would be on the same subject,",Counterclaim
"Although, at the end of the day, students connect to each other better than teachers do. Summer projects being designed by students will be much more interesting and fun for students to complete. Students understand how other students do not want to do school work over the summer, so a student-designed project will be more interesting and less challenging! ",Counterclaim
" Some may believe that having a teacher-designed project would be better,",Counterclaim
"People may think that having a teacher-designed project would be more fair to everyone,",Counterclaim
Some think that students should be given teacher-designed projects over the break so they will be more encouraged to finish them.,Counterclaim
"However, not everyone would agree with this position. Some people may argue that teacher should designed the summer project. For example it challenging and you will learn more. ",Counterclaim
Some may say that students should design these summer projects in order to exercise freedom and creativity.,Counterclaim
"While some may argue that student-designed projects are better because they fit the individual learning style of each student,",Counterclaim
"Some may say, students are better off designing their own project because they know what will be best for themselves over the summer. That student-designed projects will give students a window of opportunity to show their maturity on creating a project. ",Counterclaim
 I would probably come up with my own idea for a project.,Counterclaim
"However, teacher-designed projects can help a student be better educated on the topic he/she gets confused about. The project can help the student understand the topic better. If the teacher designs a project for the students to complete over the break, the students would have an enormous amount of time to complete research on the topic and do their project. And by the end of the project, the students would have a deeper understanding of the topic since they had to do research and finish the project. For example, a teacher would design a topic that he/she knows the students have a hard time understanding. The students would need to take time during their break to do research on the topic and then connect their ideas about the topic into their project. After finishing the project, the students would have a much deeper understanding of the topic. ",Counterclaim
"With limited extra work and limited research it may make one think that they're not really learning, ",Counterclaim
"Although, if students were to design their own summer project, then they would build independent and creativity skills.",Counterclaim
Some may say that teacher-designed summer projects would be better because it may be harder and challenge the students more. Also teacher-designed projects may relate to school more and what they might learn in the future because many teachers have a lot of experience. Student's may also have a hard time coming up with their own ideas and could take longer ,Counterclaim
"Although some individuals believe that students should be given the freedom to design a summer project that specifically interests the student,",Counterclaim
" Some may argue that student-designed projects are more beneficial,",Counterclaim
"What about the teachers? That's a question that you would ask. The pros of teachers creating the summer projects is for the unity that it gives the projects making it easier for the teachers to grade,",Counterclaim
 The major issue that could come up is the fact that most teachers use the summer projects as a way to teach the first lesson of year by the ability of already having background information on it and being able to give quizzes on it to test the students knowledge. ,Counterclaim
While they might sound easier for the student to do,Counterclaim
"Some may say, that students could potentially make their assignments too easy and will not put in enough work. They could take advantage of how much creativity they can show by hindering how much creativity they actually put into the project. If they did that, they would not show their true artistic potential in the assignment",Counterclaim
"Some may say that students will hold back and not try things that may take more work, like was mentioned in the second paragraph",Counterclaim
"Some people would say otherwise. That the kids need projects to keep them on target for the year. Or to already be practicing for their classes for next year. That it can only benefit us in our life. Parents could say that they will make time for their children work and remind them of what they have to do for school even on the break. Also that teachers guidelines would restrict the work to something appropriate, or meaningful to school. ",Counterclaim
"Some people say that the students should be designing the projects because they need the experience, freedom, and responsibility that comes with designing a project from scratch. ",Counterclaim
" I know that some classes, mainly dual enrollment and AP classes, have projects designed by the students ",Counterclaim
"Some individuals may say it would also be simple when a teacher assigns it, because every student will be doing the same project,",Counterclaim
Some say that students may not take teacher-designed projects seriously either.,Counterclaim
Some teacher think that the students shouldnt make their own prompts because i guess the teachers want the prompts to have reasons to them.,Counterclaim
Some of the students may want to do a student-designed project because they feel that they will get it done in time and have came up with an idea.,Counterclaim
"Student-designed summer projects claim to be beneficial as they allow students freedom in choosing the topics students study and the type of work they prefer to do, allowing them to be more invested in their work as well as boosting productivity and creativity. ",Counterclaim
"Although many might say it is not a smart idea to allow students to design summer projects because students will just always pick the easy way out,",Counterclaim
Teachers may say that some students in the school environment don't want to complete their work because they are to lazy or just don't want to do it ,Counterclaim
Some may say teacher designed projects are laid out and organized better than what a student can produce;,Counterclaim
Even though some people say that teacher-designed will be so much better because students will tend to take it seriously than a student-designed; ,Counterclaim
Some may believe that teacher-designed p assure learning over break because they believe that teachers know what students need to do stimulate their brains.,Counterclaim
"While others may say they should be teacher designed since they think they know what is best for the students or they should be able to know what they are going to be grading rather than being blind-sided with a project on a random topic,",Counterclaim
This statement could be countered with a claim that states that the students should design these assignments to help insure that they better understand the material.,Counterclaim
 The teacher may have one perception of how rigorous a class is. ,Counterclaim
some people might say that is not true and if we allow students to do whatever they feel like doing then how are we suppose to make them do anything educational and how do you think it is going to help them in life.,Counterclaim
" Those who disagree state that teachers should in fact be creating these projects due to more knowledge, and guidelines they so desire,",Counterclaim
"Those who disagree state that teachers should take the initiative and lead these various projects to implement guidelines, to cover content that their students would be learning more of later in the upcoming year, and because they know what's best for them and have more knowledge on the matter,",Counterclaim
"Although student-designed summer projects are often more in-touch with other students, ",Counterclaim
"There are beliefs that teachers should be monitoring and producing summer work for the students themselves. Supposedly, the perspectives of the teachers are valuable, and the projects produced would be putting a massive amount of pressure than of being produced by the students themselves. Although teachers do have high standards and expect the best amount of effort possible,",Counterclaim
Some people might say summer projects should be teacher-designed because they have more knowledge than students;,Counterclaim
"Although, teachers assigning teacher designed work to students work over the summer establishes more structure and easier communication on the assignment and its requirements,",Counterclaim
"Although students creating their own assignments can create more interest and learning opportunities for them, teacher assignments provide a type of structure, formality, and stability it might be difficult for the student to achieve in their design. ",Counterclaim
"Lastly, although students designing their own projects would make it easier for them, they don't actually know what they need to be learning for the upcoming school year. ",Counterclaim
some may argue that a student designed projects help students learn more because more effort has to go in.,Counterclaim
 some may argue that if they would get some motivation from say there parents then more effort would get put in thus leading to more learning. ,Counterclaim
 Some may argue that the teacher could try and answer as many questions as possible before the break.,Counterclaim
"Others may argue that the summer project should be teacher-designed. The teachers get to pick what the students project is going to be about. The teacher's could give them a project that's school related or not school related. They get to decide if they want the students to be creative and colorful. Most teachers want want their students to be creative in their project because it can give them more points added to their grade at the end. Also, they get to decide what kind of format it's going to be on like: line paper, drawing paper, a poster board, or on a computer. Right after the the teacher assign the project, they would tell the students what kind of format they want it to be on. The project should be teacher deisgned so they can be in charge of the project.",Counterclaim
"I can also understand the teachers perspective, they want the kids to learn more over the summer and be prepared for the next year so they assign projects that will help them and expect it to be finished ",Counterclaim
"Some may claim that the project must be chosen by teachers, as it is their occupation and that they know what is best for the students to succeed.",Counterclaim
A common misconception from teachers is that all students should be given an equal opportunity at the same assignment,Counterclaim
While many students would argue that they should make the projects ,Counterclaim
While teacher-designed projects are easier to create,Counterclaim
Some people might say that the summer projects should be teacher-designed because then the students would not have to rush at the end of summer to get all of these projects done or that they would not have to worry about coming up with projects to do during the summer.,Counterclaim
some students will most likely forget about it anyway because its summer,Counterclaim
"Some people think that students should have control over their summer projects, because they know what works for them, and their summer shouldn't be spent stressing over a project. That does make sense,",Counterclaim
"While many negatives can include; abuse of lack of parameters, disregard of deadlines, and even failure to complete the project at all ",Counterclaim
"While it is true that much of the years learning can be forgotten or simply isnt retained during the summer,",Counterclaim
"While a teacher designed summer project may be benefical, some may argue that students would do better with a student designed project because they understand the struggles of eachother and can help reduce how much work needs to be done while also teaching the student ",Counterclaim
"Some people might say student-designed projects are more beneficial because it allows for more flow of creativity when learning,",Counterclaim
While student-designed projects may offer a more engaging topic for students,Counterclaim
 student-designed projects would be cooler for the students to have their own project and not be assigned one. It can also help them learn more as much as not help them learn more because students who actually do their own work and choose good questions for the project can help them be successful. ,Counterclaim
Some may believe that summer projects should be student-designed in order for students to take on more responsibility.,Counterclaim
Although some may say that teachers should be the ones to design summer projects for their students,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, if students design their own projects that could help them mature.
",Counterclaim
"Some may say that when students are given the opportunity to choose what they want to learn, they will take advatage of that and pick something easy or irrelevant to learn. ",Counterclaim
Teachers are trying to make the project students are required to do teacher-designed. ,Counterclaim
 Although all students dislike the summer work that the teachers push on them,Counterclaim
"Although many believe that these summer projects should be teacher-designed as the teacher is the most trusthworthy to design as they are also the ones to grade the project, ",Counterclaim
Critics say that summer projects should be teacher designed because it keeps the student following a stricted guideline. ,Counterclaim
although the kids can actually make it interesting and relevant to them,Counterclaim
Although students may argue that they can actually make the project for interesting and more relevant for them.,Counterclaim
"They can also argue that free time is really important,",Counterclaim
"Some teachers will say that students shouldnt make up their own projects because if it is a group project or at home project most kids wants to play with their friends have sleepovers and do other kid/teenager like activities. What makes you think that kids wants to make their own project if in the morning they dont even want to wake up for school, so in the summer that means they want to get they sleep in because in the summer for kids and teenagers that means no school no homework no more teachers and no waking up early in the morning. ",Counterclaim
Some people may argue that allowing students to set the bar on their own academic rigor will allow them a scapegoat to choose easy topics. ,Counterclaim
" Although, relating to each other when creating these projects is a great thing, some students will think otherwise. Some students will say that they enjoy the summer assignments that teachers give and don't want students to take that away.",Counterclaim
While some schools may argue that teacher-designed projects align with the concepts addressed in class ,Counterclaim
"Although schools utilize teacher-designed projects for summer learning because they stay within the confines of the teacher's syllabus,",Counterclaim
"Some people may claim that giving students the ability to design their own project is not ""giving"" but ""forcing"". Students may need guidelines in order to work properly and receive a fair grade for their effort. Or worst case, they simply won't do the work. If a student needs a step-by-step process on how to recount their learning, then how will they expect to fend for themselves once they graduate?",Counterclaim
"With recent generations of learners displaying less and less focus throughout the years, some might to disprove the effectiveness of student based projects. ""Given full control over the projects parameters,"" one might claim, ""students will become far too focused on obsolete details like font, backgrounds, and pictures."" Someone who might hold this point of view believes a hands-off approach from teachers will only result in lower quality work and declining focus on the course material. ",Counterclaim
"Although many individuals believe that student designed summer projects are more beneficial to the development of a childs path towards gaining knowledge,",Counterclaim
"Some may argue that if summer projects were teacher-designed, then the teachers could regulate and prepare the students better for the upcoming school year. ",Counterclaim
Some may disagree that the individual student should design their own summer project because it insures the student is learning while getting some enjoment and individuality.,Counterclaim
"Although these views are correct, there are some who disagree. Some people believe that students don't learn when creating their own projects to do. They also believe that students aren't capable of doing their own project without the assistance of a teacher. ",Counterclaim
" However, in high school, it is better to give students more freedom because in their careers they will not always have someone telling them what to do every step of the way and they will have to think for themselves",Counterclaim
"Some may argue today that teachers should keep designing these summer projects for the students because they are the teachers.

Some individuals argue that students should accept the assignment and complete it because it is their job to do so. ",Counterclaim
I understand where they teachers are coming from and trying to assign the students these summer projects and making sure they are ready for their upcoming classes.,Counterclaim
I do understand why teachers believe that summer projects would help students continue learning. Summer projects does help students stay on task and busy and prepare them for their upcoming classes.,Counterclaim
"Although teacher-designed summer projects tend to be more standardized and fairly graded,",Counterclaim
"Some people may say otherwise that student designed projects could be equally as helpful and less time consuming and allow students to be responsible for the time they spend on their work, ",Counterclaim

Some people may argue that student-based projects can be self managed and allow students to be responsible to buckle down to complete it too. ,Counterclaim
Some may argue that student-based projects allow the teachers to not have to take responsibility for whether students learned anything or not because it also could provide practice in a life skill that is self-teaching which could be helpful in college etc. ,Counterclaim
 many others think that the summer projects should be student-designed. Those would think that since it's a project to do over the summer;many students should have a say. Their own choice to choose what should be done for their project and how it should be done. That would be giving them the opportunity for them to do something and be able to start from the beginning with it.,Counterclaim
"Others may be bias and say student-designed summer projects should be used. As it may create less stress and less of a burden throughout the summer, making it not so difficult and easier to finish. So they can enjoy the rest of their summer break without worry. ",Counterclaim
Although some believe these summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers are more responsible ,Counterclaim
Although teacher-designed projects are more organized and favored by teachers themselves ,Counterclaim
Some may argue that student designed projects will benifit the student more than a teacher designed project because of the chance of an easy grade.,Counterclaim
"if the project was designed by the teacher it would b a more stable and set curriculum. The teacher knows exactly what they are looking for, so for the project to be designed by a teacher would allow for the project to be more organized. ",Counterclaim

"Some people may believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed,",Counterclaim
Students may choose an alternative design for a summer project to weasel their way out of doing little to no work at all. ,Counterclaim
Some may argue that teacher-designed projects are fairer to students because they assign every student the same project.,Counterclaim
Some students may not think that teachers know what they are talking about ,Counterclaim
"however, the same can be said for a teacher-designed project, ",Counterclaim
"Some may say that all school projects should be designed by the teacher,",Counterclaim
If teachers designed the summer projects they would have more indepth questions and work to do that would get students brains thinking and learning. Teacher also know all of the critearia that has to be followed. Teachers are able to make projects fun and enjoyable as well as give the students a little stuggle with the work so they would actually be learning instead of just flying right through the project.,Counterclaim
Now some teachers or even parents may see this as a way for students to slack and turn in mediocre work as a sort of side effect of having control,Counterclaim
"I understand why some may believe that summer assignments should be required in order to allow the child to learn and become independent in their education,",Counterclaim
 Some students may abuse this opportunity by trying to complete projects on completely noneducational of inappropriate;,Counterclaim
Some say that a student designed project would help the student because it caters to their intrests and needs.,Counterclaim
it's said that students work better when they're intrested about the subject ,Counterclaim

There is a small flaw in having the projects being completely student-designed: lack of motivation. ,Counterclaim

Some people might say that a student designed summer project would defeat the purpose of having one because theyll still forget what they have learned.,Counterclaim
"If the project was to be designed by the students, there are too many easy ways out. ",Counterclaim
"Now, this assignment can not be a free for all, that would not be completely fair. There may be some students who go above and beyond while some may do the bare minimum and call it done. ",Counterclaim
"Although teacher- designed projects are more organized and simple to follow,",Counterclaim
"However, some people may argue that summer projects should be teacher designed and not student designed. They say that because some people believe that the teacher knows best for the students because they are the ones that really know the material and subject. ",Counterclaim
Some may argue that students would not take the projects seriously or that students could do something inappropriate in these projects. ,Counterclaim
Some people who believe that teachers should design summer project may argue that because they are the ones that create student assignments and projects for students on a day to day basis they would be able to create a project more efficiently in comparison to a student. ,Counterclaim
Another argument that could be made as to why teachers should make summer projects is that teachers will create projects tailored for the student as they work with them the whole year,Counterclaim
"While some people think letting a teacher designed the projects is better because it's less work for students, less stress on students, and less time consuming,",Counterclaim
Proponents of student designed projects may argue that student designed projects will make students more passionate about the project ,Counterclaim
" On the other hand, people think that teachers would make things happen faster than what the teachers are doing.",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, people believe that students would be in the way of trying to create a summer project.",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, people think that it should be done by teachers so it can be understood more.",Counterclaim
"Teachers could say, ""These projects are simple, your just reading a book and answering easy questions."" What if some students can't actually read? What if some students just aren't good with English in general? ",Counterclaim
"Although if students designed their own projects, there's always the ones that are lazy and don't do school work and that the project will just be simple, plain, and of no benefit towards them.",Counterclaim
"Some may argue that summer projects should be student-designed, because students understand each other. ",Counterclaim
"Some people may say that a teacher-designed project is vital for providing students with the necessary base to create a meaningful project,",Counterclaim
Some people may say that a teacher-designed project will provide students with the same opportunities to develop their skills. ,Counterclaim
Some people may say that a teacher-designed project would still give students the opportunity to discover their interests.,Counterclaim
Some teachers might say that their assignments are made to help students and there is no excuse to not completing them.,Counterclaim
"some might say that giving students choice in their projects would lead to many not pursuing anything of value. If the purpose of the summer project is to ""continue learning"" when kids aren't at school, isn't it a risk to give students the freedom to research something unrelated to their academic studies?",Counterclaim
"Some may say that if the projects were student-designed, it would push them to complete the work because they were allowed a say-so in what had to be done. ",Counterclaim
Some would say that it is not a good idea to allow students to create these assignments because they'll make them to easy or won't really try when they make it.,Counterclaim
Despite this valid reasons there are does who think teacher should pick the topic. ,Counterclaim
Some might say that these summer projects should be student-designed since the student is the one doing the project and it's during their summer time ,Counterclaim
"
Some still may argue though that summer projects should be teacher designed because they'll assign the correct learning material that they want us to work on and ensure that we don't forget.",Counterclaim
"Many would say that teenagers need more autonomy, so having them do their own project would be better for their development ",Counterclaim
"The only downside to student designed projects is the way of grading and assessing their work. The more freedom students are given within a project, the further projects are going to be from what a rubric wants, which can be a pain for teachers",Counterclaim
"Teachers and parents alike may agree that it is more beneficial to have teacher designed projects, since they have more structured experience as well as having mastered the material.",Counterclaim
"Although some may argue that a teacher issued summer assingment limits the students ability to expand ones creativity, ",Counterclaim
"Even though students could take advantage of the oppertunity by taking initiative on task assigned to them,",Counterclaim
"Although critics may argue that individuality can be benefical to ones work ethic, ",Counterclaim
Some may argue that teachers give an excessive amount of uncessary workload;,Counterclaim
Some could argue that it is more beneficial for students to design summer projects because students can make them more enjoyable. ,Counterclaim
Some students argue that they should be the ones to design their summer projects because they find it more enjoyable for them to complete their projects that way.,Counterclaim
Some may say that the lack of format or instructions will cause worse performances with the project.,Counterclaim
some say summer assignments shouldn't be student-designed because it's not going to be as organized ,Counterclaim
Now what is not always true is that every kid are not capable of designing their own summer program.,Counterclaim
"Even with the plethora of benefits to student-designed projects, there is an argument for teacher-designed projects being more essential to student learning. Student-designed projects have been countered by many, detailing that they are very time-consuming and stray away from crucial learning targets since each student is focusing on a different topic.",Counterclaim
"Although letting students design their own summer projects would let them express their freedom and creativity,",Counterclaim
"By having students designing the projects they might not learn as much as they need to. This is why teachers do all the designing. Teachers make it harder and longer for students becuase doing it short and simple is too easy and you are not learning anything that way. They also make the deadline shorter because they know students will get it done. If the time is too long the students will most likely end up forgetting about it. Teachers also detail their projects more because the want students to know more than the basics of what they are trying to teach. This will educate the student more, that way when summer is over and the next school year comes around students have it freshly stuck in their heads and will not struggle as much. ",Counterclaim
There are those who believe that students should have teacher-designed summer projects,Counterclaim
"Some people might say that teacher designed project would be better and more effective as it is the teachers job to teach the students, ",Counterclaim
"Some people do not necessarily agree with this position. They argue saying, "" Students should design the summer project, so they can easily fit the projects into their schedules"".",Counterclaim
Some people might disagree and say that it should be teacher designed since the educator knows what they should be learning and how they should be learning it. ,Counterclaim
If they had the opportunity to create their own project it would be beneficial to them because they are willing to put in the work.,Counterclaim
"While some may argue that student-designed projects encourage lazy and uninspired design, by designing projects themselves,",Counterclaim
"some may argue that allowing students to design their own project encourages the design of lazy, easy, and uninspired projects. After all, why would a student intentionally design a complex project for a time span intended to be a break?",Counterclaim
"Teachers could argue that there are more learning benefits for the students if it is teacher-designed,",Counterclaim
One might argue that teacher-designed summer projects are better for students learning and skills. Teacher-designed projects would probably be a little more straight forward and tell the students exactly what they are looking for in their projects. They might also benefit students in an area that they struggled in before; the projects could be focused around one specific subject for each student. Teacher-designed projects would probably be much easier for teachers to grade because they would most likely make a rubric and guidelines for the projects. ,Counterclaim
"The only bad side anyone can possibly see in this is the topic. Students, when let lose, can tend to get off topic and not realize it. They get to caught up in their mind that they lose what the requirements are. ",Counterclaim
Some people may say if the student pick they arent really going to learn any thing. ,Counterclaim
Some may argue that the students wont learn anything if they chose what they are doing. ,Counterclaim
"However, it can not be guaranteed that the students will learn or understand the homework assignment. For that reason could be that maybe the student is not ready to take on that particular topic. Without a doubt, it is known that not all students learn the same way and not all understand what they have learned. Everybody learns at their own pace and in their own way ",Counterclaim
Some may say that allowing a student to plan a project and design it them selves in wrong because its a teachers job to design the assignment,Counterclaim
"Those who oppose this may say that student-designed projects allow the students to choose freely. They argue that free choice by the students will allow the student to be more interested in the topic and actually learn more. If students can freely design their own individual projects, then they may put more effort into the project and make more of an attempt to learn. ",Counterclaim
"some may believe that it is better for the teacher to design the assignment, because the teacher knows what students need to improve on, so the teachers would provide students with exactly what they need to practice. They might also believe that if a student was to design the assignment, they would purposely make it simple and deny themselves the opportunity to learn. They may also agree that teachers should make the assignments because the teacher is in a position of power in the classroom. ",Counterclaim
"Those who disagree may state that summer projects should be teacher-designed because it leads to more efficiency and ensures the project follows specific required guidelines,",Counterclaim
Some people may believe that the curriculum is the most important part of school and that is why the teachers should be designing the summer projects. They would argue that some students would fail at the task of designing their own projects.,Counterclaim
Others might suggest that having fewer questions and less pages will just decrease a student's time spent learning or reviewing material. ,Counterclaim
Some can argue that teachers can pick just as fascinating topics as students. ,Counterclaim
People might suggest that teachers know the material the best so they will form the best summer packet.,Counterclaim
"Some may say teachers should design the assignments because they know the subjects better,",Counterclaim
"The ones that disagree will probably say that teachers should design the projects. They may say that the teacher knows what is best for their students and that if the students have some authority over their project, they will do or pick something that does nothing for their knowledge and education. They may also say that they need to learn that not everything can got their way in life and they have to deal with what is front of them ",Counterclaim
"Teachers may have difficulty grading the projects if they don't make the assignments themselves.
",Counterclaim
"Students may get caught up in using their creativity and having fun, that they lose sight of the assignment's purpose. ",Counterclaim
Some people think that students should be given a teacher-designed project over the summer. People think that students should get the teacher project because it will be better leaning for the students. People think it will be more beneficial for the students. Some people think that students should be giving a teacher project over the summer ,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, having the teachers design the projects would be a better organization beacuse they can lay out the requirements of the project. Even though the kids would'nt think the project would be fun the teachers would think otherwise ",Counterclaim
"However, some may not agree on this position. Some points to take in consideration are that not all students will like the topic and may not know a lot on that specific that's assigned.",Counterclaim
"detractors may argue that teacher designed summer projects connect the student to the curriculum better than student designed summer projects can,",Counterclaim
But what happens if we get injured because of the war going on there? Won't the ship sink?,Counterclaim
Some other people think it is dangerous to be a Seagoing Cowboy ,Counterclaim
Some people might say it would be to boring to be on a ship in the middle of the sea with nothing to do and they would miss friends and families because it a long trip.,Counterclaim
They might also say they have no point in doing this.,Counterclaim
"The toughest part of this job was going over a bunch of water and getting the animals back to where they belonged.

The down sides of being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you will have to travel far from home and stay away from your family for long periods of time and you wouldn't get to see them much. ,Counterclaim
Some people say that it was dangerous,Counterclaim
"Third, some bad things about it",Counterclaim

"However, some people may say that they don't like to go places.",Counterclaim
However people may say that they don't like to go on adventures. ,Counterclaim
"The only bad thing was, my mother was not proud, in fact, she wasn't happy at all.

She thought becoming a Seagoing Cowboy would put me in danger,",Counterclaim
It does take a lot of time to be a Seagoing Cowboy ,Counterclaim
Some may argue that sending all of the animals overseas might reduce the animal population in that country that is sending them away. ,Counterclaim
"On the other hand people will say that they have already seen the Acropolis or China or Europe, ",Counterclaim
Other might think it isn't fun at all ,Counterclaim
Others might look the other way and think the opposite.,Counterclaim
Some people think that you could get hurt yourself then who whould help you?,Counterclaim
" The only problem is if you get sea sick a lot, cause we are out on the sea ",Counterclaim
You might say I have to clean up poop gross.,Counterclaim
There is one thing you have to take a boat over sea and that took two weeks!,Counterclaim
"Yes, it's an adventure ",Counterclaim
i know its a opportunity of a lifetime ,Counterclaim
"There is a lot of hardwork,",Counterclaim
It can get hard somwtimes,Counterclaim
"The bad thing is that you are gone from home for a while. Sometimes you could get hert when you are at the seagoing cowboys because, it is vary rainy at times. You couuld brake your ribs by checking on the animals in the rain.

"Expriencing new things can be terryifying, ",Counterclaim
"Some people may get scared because they are in the middel of the sea and they lile to be with there famielys at night so the familys can keep them safe.
",Counterclaim
some people might think that when you are in the middel of the sea you are risking your life and you should not risk your life to go at sea.,Counterclaim
"You are always on a boat, so you can't be scared of boats or the water and you can't be a person who gets sea sick a lot.",Counterclaim
Some of the bad things about joining this program is the hard work and danger.,Counterclaim
And I see why people do not want to join the program.,Counterclaim
"Im not saying thats its all fun and games because its not. One time I even broke my ribs while on the boat as you can see in paragraph 7. Boats will tip over,sink or they might even rock.",Counterclaim
"when you are a Seagoing Cowboy sometimes it can be intersting but, other times it can be painful",Counterclaim
"In some peoples mind, they think that Seagoing isnt usefull,",Counterclaim
" People also think that all we have to do is work,",Counterclaim
"Some may say that grueling hard work is not a reason to volunteer for something, ",Counterclaim
"Some people may argue that the experience isn't worth risking your life over, ",Counterclaim
 Some may say you are better off in the military. ,Counterclaim
"People opposed to the UNRRA may have many doubts why you would risk the danger and time. It is true that you sail where destructive and gruesome battles have taken place,",Counterclaim
Even though some may also state that it is too much scrificed time away from home ,Counterclaim
Some people may love home but really want to go on this trip. They also may not want to leave their beautiful family behind all by themselves.,Counterclaim
"Some people would probably refuse to go to another country that had just been through war some people would say it was to risky and unsafe well it is, some people might say that it is too dangerous to cross the ocean ",Counterclaim
But some people might say that they wouldnt go there because once again it's just too dangerous or that if they wanted to go there then they definetly not go on a boat and they would much more want to fly there,Counterclaim
Most people think being a Seagoing Cowboy is all hard work and that we don't have any fun ,Counterclaim
"I'm not going to spoil all the fun of being a Seagoing Cowboy beause I want you to fell exitement when you hopefully want to become one. I did miss my family,",Counterclaim
" Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a lot of work, ",Counterclaim
if you don't like staying on ships that long you wont like the Seagoing program.,Counterclaim
It is still kind of risky because people still break their ribs and not get to work for a couple of days and not get paid or you could die from sickness or broken ribs and if you get sea sick you won't want to go into the seagoing program ,Counterclaim
"If you aint interested yet than thats your loss,",Counterclaim

"Some may say ""Oh well

Luke wasted his life being a Seagoing Cowboy."" ",Counterclaim
You might be saying why would i waste years of my life for this?,Counterclaim
You will have some bumps and bruises along the way,Counterclaim
"But being in the program also involves hard work, and if you are wanting to help others in need than that work must be done. ",Counterclaim
It might be a long trip ,Counterclaim
"it would be bad if they were sick since you didnt take care of them,",Counterclaim
Some children might not want to go to this program,Counterclaim
"Although Luke had broken his ribs in paragraph

7,",Counterclaim
 But he also made a bad disision to take time out of his time to make it where he could play with his own friends and if I were him I would join but I woulnt because it would be bad if I couldnt get to hang out with my friends. ,Counterclaim
"It might be a little hard at first ,and rough,",Counterclaim
"Well, I can see all of thoses things in America, can't I",Counterclaim
"Some people say that seafaring is dangerous, or that you will not make it out alive if the ship sinks.",Counterclaim
Another reason you might not want to go is because you might get seasick. ,Counterclaim

" Some may not agree,",Counterclaim
How long did it take to get there? What if I don't like the jobs there and the people are rude? Are the jobs boring? What if its not the same as it was when you were there? I don't like those kind of jobs where you have to go overseas. ,Counterclaim
Is it a unique adventure getting there? What if I don't like the way they do things and your telling me a different story? ,Counterclaim
"Although, there are many dangers to the sea during this job such as slipping and possibly falling out of the ship. ",Counterclaim
" Many people may disagree with me and argue that the trip is not necessary. Why?

Well many people would say this trip is dangerous ",Counterclaim
"Now your probably wondering "" Why should i join this program? It's just a job to be on a boat with a bunch of animals."" ",Counterclaim
Some people thinks its funny to watch other contenets to bein war.,Counterclaim
 Even though there is so much fun,Counterclaim
You might not think it was fun,Counterclaim
Although sometimes you can die from being thrown over board by the waves and wind ,Counterclaim
"You have to be prepared for long, rocking, swaying trips. If just reading those words made you sick then I suggest you don't go",Counterclaim
"Now this job is not as easy as it seems and it can be dangerous, as you can clearly see that the text states, ""Luke was on night watch and slide on something, luckily he did not fall in to the atlantic but he still could not work do to the broken ribs.""

" You sometimes can risk yourself working the nightwatch in the rain because I slid down a ladder, and cracked my ribs ",Counterclaim
Some people think that being a Seagoing Cowboy is dangerous. ,Counterclaim
You might have to risk your life sometimes,Counterclaim
"Although it takes a lot of time,",Counterclaim
There is a lot of work involved and you have to be willing to do it.,Counterclaim
If you get sea sick or homesick easy then it is not a good idea to join!,Counterclaim
"Sure there are dangers of being a seagoing cowboy,",Counterclaim
If you do become a seagoing cowboy remember its a lot of responsibility that you have to take care of.,Counterclaim
" Although there are a few risks, such as stormy weather, ",Counterclaim
 Sure it might sound boring because your on a ship for so long ,Counterclaim
Others might argue by saying that all of this is too expensive and it cost a lot of money. ,Counterclaim
There are there flaws though it's kinda hard to be constantly on the move with a spouse or heck maybe kids too just at home.,Counterclaim
What if I don't want to help said one of the people Luke had ask and what if I don't like taking care of people or animals,Counterclaim
"The cons of being a part of Seagoing Cowboys Program is you have to work very hard , you have to do your part . Anthother thing if you get seasick it would be extra challenging , because your on a boat for serval mothes and weeks at a time",Counterclaim
"It is a dangerous job though. ""One rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as I shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped my slide, keeping me from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. I was happy to be alive. But I couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs."" paragraph 7. That shows Seagiong is a dangerous job and it's very serious trying not to get hurt. ",Counterclaim
"Okay,yes,it says in the passage that One rainy night,after making his hourly report to the captain,Luke slid down a slippery ladder on his backside and cracked his ribs. ",Counterclaim
I mean of course they would probably hesitate at first because they would be so far from home.,Counterclaim
I know most of you people are saying I dont want to join seagoing program because I dont have the money. ,Counterclaim
"I know some of you don't really care for animals, ",Counterclaim
It may take a long time to get there and back,Counterclaim
". annother thing is that there are about 335 horses, so if you are affraid of horses then this program isn't for you. ",Counterclaim
 Sure it is dangerous but,Counterclaim
"Although it sound all fun and games, there are risk",Counterclaim
"""why would I want to this job... I am not a farmer and I don't like animals that much?"" said the guy. ",Counterclaim
Lukes job is pretty fun although it can be very dangerous,Counterclaim
 when you go on the adventure it's going to take you abundance of days to get where you need to be ,Counterclaim
I believe that extracurricular activities are perfectly fine.,Counterclaim
"While I think that having extracurricular activities after school is a great idea, some might think that it could take too much time and iterefere with homework time.",Counterclaim
" Some people might say that some extracurricular activities, like sports, can cause injuries ",Counterclaim
Sometimes none of the activities catch the eyes of a student.,Counterclaim
"Some people may think otherwise, for example some students may think it's a bad idea for students to have to participate in at least one school activity",Counterclaim
There is indeed a lot of students who finds extracurricular activities fun and easy,Counterclaim
"Some say that when students participate in new activities it can give them a better attitude and make them distress,",Counterclaim
playing a sport is bad for some students. ,Counterclaim
"However, some people argue that students should be able to choose whether or not they want to participate in extracurricular activities in school. They cite people such as Jessica Grant, a professor from the West Virginia University of Psychological Studies, who said, ""when people have a choice in what they do, they tend to feel the benefits much more than those who are forced to do something."" ",Counterclaim
"Some people believe that students may be to busy for these activities. Editor Jerry Ram from the Michigan Company says that ""Students and teachers are busy a lot of the times, kids have homework and other things going on in their lives."" ",Counterclaim
"A lot of people on the other side say rule goes against people's right to make a choice for themselves. The most common example they use for this is that, in a study made by Mental Psychology University, 40% of students with lower self esteem and social problems often stay in their shell, out of habit and anger of being forced to participate. ",Counterclaim
But i understand how some people can not like these things they could have social anxieties or maybe they are not good at sports i understand ,Counterclaim
One popular argument is parents may not have the time to drop their child off at their club,Counterclaim
Another argument is children may not have time to participate in a club due to homework ,Counterclaim
"Lastly, some parents argue that they do not want to pay for their child to do an activity. ",Counterclaim
It would help us in somemany ways ,Counterclaim
But some people think that extracurricular activities are just a waste of time and that they don't really matter in the life.,Counterclaim
"If we look on the other side of this argument, the point is that students should take extracurricular activities to better themselves.",Counterclaim
"Unfortunately, many people still believe extracurricular activities are expensive and a waste of time.",Counterclaim
"the other point of view, It would be another thing added to a students list and another thing they would have to stress about ",Counterclaim
Even though participating in extra activities gives you a better chance at getting into colleges ,Counterclaim
"While some may say that kids have too much free time and we should give them something to do so they aren't on electronics, ",Counterclaim
I can see a probable reason the principal made this choice. I assume it is because the principal does not want there to be empty clubs/programs and that makes sense ,Counterclaim
But some kids would like it because they like sports or to work on the yearbook for the school or take serve on the student council.,Counterclaim
"Now the only reason I'm disagreeing with my principal is because he/she said I must attend an extracurricular activity. Some students don't have a club or sports team to attend, so an extracurricular activity would be a great idea for these people.",Counterclaim
 However not everyone has friends and not everyone has social skills.,Counterclaim
"However, some people will agree with doing an extra activity,",Counterclaim
"School clubs are a very good way to meet new friends, have fun, and learn. ",Counterclaim
"some people argue that having these teams and a type of competitiveness which can cause kids to be rude and be unkind to the other teammates who they think is ""not good enough""",Counterclaim
Some people argue that school should only be for academics. ,Counterclaim
"on the other hand, maybe we shouldnt have these activities because the schools already put enough money into teaching kids do we need to spend more money on this activities? ",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, some people claim that extracurricular activities are just a waste of time. ",Counterclaim
Others may say that we should not have extracurricular activities because it pushes student boundaries. ,Counterclaim
What if the students make more friends?,Counterclaim
 I would be fine with this idea because i love sports and that is something i'm interested in ,Counterclaim
Some students arent able to go after school. Some students have lots of homework and don't have any way to leave the school. ,Counterclaim
People who don't like extracurricular activities say that requiring students to join out-of-school activities deprives them of time after school to complete homework. ,Counterclaim
"Someone might say that, it will allow students to make new friends. ",Counterclaim
Another argument would be that it would help students stop being so lazy.,Counterclaim
There are some people who may argue against everyone having to participate in an extracurricular activity. They may say that they don't have the time to participate and if they do then they won't get their school work done. ,Counterclaim
You may also argue that there are no extracurricular activities that are offered that you want to participate in. ,Counterclaim
student grades can fall from the lack of focus from these activities,Counterclaim
"You might be thinking that time management is a good skill to practice, in which you're not wrong",Counterclaim
" I know what people would say ""oh, but they may just find a hidden talent they never knew they had"".",Counterclaim
"not all extracurricular activities are fun, Sometimes students go to an activity be themselves and do not enjoy it. They think doing extracurricular activities are not all rays of sunshine,",Counterclaim
Although you might not be thrilled about staying after school ,Counterclaim
Although you might think extracurricular activities are boring ,Counterclaim
"Many people say that students should be able to choose what they would like to do,",Counterclaim
Many people would argue that extracurricular activities are a great way to make new friends and have fun. ,Counterclaim
"Maybe staying after school could help increase students self-confidence, make new friends, or increase their mental health. ",Counterclaim
some cases activities can be good for children.,Counterclaim
some may say extracurricular activities are a waste of time and money. Some activities might require fees and time after school.,Counterclaim
some people believe it shouldn't be required to do some sort of extracurricular activity because they would take up unnecessary time ,Counterclaim
The problem that most people have with after school programs is that it decreases the time for getting homework done on time. ,Counterclaim
"Some people might disagree with this decision. They might say '' I have other things to do,"" or, "" I don't like any of the activities provided!""",Counterclaim
"On the other hand people may think that having one extracurricular activity will help students be more happy and it's better for them. After-school activities can help you meet new people, socialize, have fun and many more things.",Counterclaim
"Although the goal of this rule would be to create a good learning environment and a chance to participate in more interactive learning experiences,",Counterclaim
Me on the other hand I like to be independent when it comes to certain things like track if you run track you most likely run alone. ,Counterclaim
but it does come at the price that some students are not able to do extracurricular activities for certain reasons. ,Counterclaim
"Of course, like any plan for schools or elsewhere, it isn't perfect. There's many things someone could say as to why they disagree with the principal's choice",Counterclaim
 A good amount of students don't do any extracurricular activities because they just don't have the time or means to participate. ,Counterclaim
"Some students don't want to do after school activities because they think there're a waste of time,",Counterclaim
"However, if dont like it, its going to be a everyday thing so soon or later you going to like it,",Counterclaim

"Some people might say ""kids need excersize"" ",Counterclaim
"I can see that there are some positive things about this decision of taking an after school activity everyday like meeting new people or learning something new, ",Counterclaim
Some people may think that extracurricular activities aren't necessary for all children but that isn't the case.,Counterclaim
You principal said all student's should have to attend a extracurricular activity. Student's are not going to want to do this.,Counterclaim
"I see why some students will disagree with my opinion on extracurricular activities because some people do have things going on in their life. I understand that some people are really shy, but its always good to step out of your comfort zone. Overall though, it is hard to talk to people when you aren't the type of person too.",Counterclaim
While kids may want to do extraculliculars,Counterclaim
" some might argue that students should not be mandated to take part in extracurricular activities, and say that teens may already have a ""full plate"" and thus become stressed ",Counterclaim
On the other Extra curricular activity come off as useless and left in the dust ,Counterclaim
But one the other hand people just seem to not care,Counterclaim
sure it would be similar if you agreed,Counterclaim
"there can be some negatives towards extracurricular activities such as getting injured, or not being able to hangout with people.
",Counterclaim
"However, many people believe that students shouldn't be the ones having to do extra work to help out.",Counterclaim
Many say that students will lose focus and interest in school when they take a part in extracurricular activities.,Counterclaim
These activities surely are expensive on school ,Counterclaim
The principal took a risk with this. The risk he took is the reaction of the parents and the teachers.,Counterclaim
Joining an outside group or involving yourself in a social setting where one participates in a hobby may be healthy and is encouraged,Counterclaim
but some student thinks one activity is not enough for them ,Counterclaim
"Although all students could possibly find something they're interested in when it comes to after school activities, such as clubs or sports,",Counterclaim
"Although some might argue that they might not have time for this after school activity because of homework or chores,",Counterclaim
"Well, what if students don't want to participate?",Counterclaim
Extracurricular activities are there for students to enjoy them and feel like they are apart of something.,Counterclaim
"However, some people don't like joining clubs because they could be antisocial or can be nervous and have trouble meeting new people ",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, students shouldn't be forced to do an extracurricular activity if the don't want to. A study done by the Loudoun County Public Activities Club (LCPAC) showed that students that were forced to sign up for and activity didn't have fun or enjoy them self.",Counterclaim
Some people may say that its a wast of time and you could be doing something academic with that time and that other activities would be more appropriate for the school day. ,Counterclaim
"I could see you thinking but if there are little kids, and they can be a little annoying. If you ask but what if the older kids run me over.",Counterclaim
This may be good for other students,Counterclaim
Most teenagers can't participate in any extracurricular activity for different reasons. ,Counterclaim
Some parents think sports are a waste of time and that you are not going to needed in the future ,Counterclaim
"
Although it's pretty clear that Generic_Name's rule should be passed, it was mentioned earlier to be controversial. This is because several parents and students at Generic_School say that this rule is infringing on their right to pursue happiness. The Constitution clearly states, when listing the rights of all U.S. citizens, ""The pursuit of happiness"" ",Counterclaim
"Having students participate in things beside schoolwork is important,",Counterclaim
"Now some people might say that it's ""too hard"",""I just dont need it"" , or "" it takes too much time"".",Counterclaim
"If you don't want to go you will have to go to the principal and explain why you can't, ",Counterclaim
Sometimes there are some disadvantages in extracurricular activity but not a lot.,Counterclaim
"Although there can be conflicts with money and time that some students might not have, ",Counterclaim
However having an extra curricular activity can mean more harm than good. ,Counterclaim
Some people argue that students will not have time for an extracurricular activity to be added to their schedule.,Counterclaim
some people might think the new system is bad because students would want to relax or hang out with friends,Counterclaim
Some people are not as fortunate as us and many sports have a fee to sign up as a result to that some families might not be able to afford that fee. ,Counterclaim
A lot of sports have practices almost every night and it might last until 9:00. So when you get home your exhausted and you don't feel like doing your homework or any project thats due soon. And its hard to find the time to do it.,Counterclaim
There is something good to it. It can make them try new stuff. ,Counterclaim
"Although some students may not be sociable, this rule could open some new doors for them, finding a new passion, or something they do in a extracurricular activities might just be their job when they get older. ",Counterclaim
doing something for the school is not bad,Counterclaim
now if some students want to participate in some of the activities they can ,Counterclaim
"However, some people may say that they don't have enough time for extracurricular activities. ",Counterclaim
"Teachers and the school, and of course mainly our principle, may think that putting down a rule to have to be ""using your time for learning and having fun"" makes us more productive. ",Counterclaim
 I also agree because it will help kids get personal stuff outta there mind,Counterclaim
Student council is actually really good,Counterclaim
The principal actually is thinking because he does what new things for them in life,Counterclaim
" Extracurricular activities do give some students the opportunity to expand their knowledge in certain areas, spend time with friends, and maybe help them find their passion in life,",Counterclaim
A supporter of required extracurricular activities would say that it allows students to try new things that they may enjoy ,Counterclaim
 A supporter of extracurricular activities would say that students would manage their time wisely. ,Counterclaim
 A supporter of extracurricular activities would say that forcing students to participate in these activities would be beneficial them ,Counterclaim
Some parents and students complain that they won't have time for homework,Counterclaim
"While some may enjoy sports or other extracurricular activities, ",Counterclaim
 I also disagree because some students need to do some at home,Counterclaim
"i disagree inone thing again some students just stay after school to finish a test,work,progetor a asy for the teacher or just stay to learn more about what there wanna do of the work or esy is wanna be about ",Counterclaim
Maybe this new rule works differntly than I guessed it would and maybe it is a good idea,Counterclaim
"Many people worry about participating in these activities, believing that students will not have enough time to focus on their studies.",Counterclaim
 at the same time it will depend on the students and how they want to spend their time. Also it could prove defective if the students feel too much pressure do to school work and the requirements needed for their specific activity.,Counterclaim
although students could have positive impacts by this decision it could also have negative impacts;,Counterclaim
Do I believe this is a good idea? Yes,Counterclaim
"But, not everyone has that packed of a schedule so for those people that could stay after for a little and kill some time, let them. ",Counterclaim
Now some may argue saying schools have enough clubs to satisfy everyone.,Counterclaim
Another posible arguement is that a club builds confidence,Counterclaim
 I understand that the principal just wants his or her students to have a healthy life,Counterclaim
"mandatory participation in an extracurricular would seem to many like a bore,",Counterclaim
Some people may say it is a bad thing to do an activity after school because there is no time for studying or homework ,Counterclaim
Outside activities are also bad because they can take up way to much time and are to far away.,Counterclaim
some people believe that extracurricular activities should not be mandatory. They say that some students prefer not to participate in an extracurricular activity.,Counterclaim
Some students might not like it because it would take time away from doing other things.,Counterclaim
While some might say that requiring participation in these activities limits the amount of time that could be spent on schoolwork ,Counterclaim
Many students use homework as an excuse not to participate in after-school activities ,Counterclaim
Another excuse is that the price to participate in these activities is too much.,Counterclaim
Carpooling may be a option,Counterclaim
"Some people may think that extracurricular activities are just a waste of time, or that it wouldn't benefit them in any way. They also might think that it would be just like school. Also, now that the principal made extracurricular activities mandatory, those people would be upset",Counterclaim
"However, some students may find it rude to be forced to do an activity. We have homework and activities outside of school ,so why do we have to stay at school for an extra hour? In order to make everyone agree with the idea of having to participate in a club we have to fix the problems.",Counterclaim
Another issue is what if parents can't pick up their child? ,Counterclaim
 For some students it can be hard to manage their time at home or might not be able to fit a few hours to complete these activities in their schedule.,Counterclaim
"this perhaps may be excellent,",Counterclaim
but the extracurricular activity here are well for kids,Counterclaim
"On the other hand staying after school would maybe help, but mostly for students who will not be busy after school.",Counterclaim
A flaw in this plan is that students might not show up and never come to any of the meetings and activities.,Counterclaim
"However, i do understand why some people may be against extracurricular activities. ",Counterclaim
While I believe that these activities may help some students,Counterclaim
"Some might argue that its called extracurricular for a reason and that it should not be mandatory and students should decide if they would like to participate or not,",Counterclaim
Most people probably think differently about trying new classes because they dont want to force there in to doing sometghing they dont wanna do.,Counterclaim
"On the other hand making students stay after school might benefit them. Some teacher may think that some of their students need extra help. So staying after school may help these students, or some student are very athletic, so if they stay after school for a sport it would help them lose of the energy they have and calm them down",Counterclaim
 If they enjoy it they can overcome the barrier with hard work and determination. ,Counterclaim
"I get that maybe your shy or something like that,",Counterclaim
"Students would rather go home and play video games,",Counterclaim
Some people might say doing extracurricular activities is a waste of time and will only distract students from their studies.,Counterclaim
"Now some people may ask, ""What if my child doesn't like sports?""",Counterclaim
"If the parents want to spend that money, they can.",Counterclaim
Some people argue that doing extracurricular activities can improve your experience at school. Most highschoolers say school is more enjoyable when you do extracurricular activities. ,Counterclaim
"Some may say that being a part of an extracurricular is good for students' futures,",Counterclaim
"Except sports are a little different.
",Counterclaim
I think other people would disagree because they don't wanna be forced to do something,Counterclaim
"extracurricular activities are great for growing teenagers, it can be a great safe space for them, ",Counterclaim
Others might say its a waste of time because not everyone wants to do it or wants to be a part of it.,Counterclaim
"You might say that not all sports are right after school, and I'd say that is correct,",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, joining an extracurricular may be fun. It's a great way to make new friends! If you're bored at school, it's something to do! It looks and sounds really fun, ",Counterclaim
"People are getting mad at Mr. Generic_Name and are leaving rude messages to the school saying , ""my kid should not have to participate if they dont want to"" ,",Counterclaim
"You may argue that many students have completely empty schedules, so this will not harm them.",Counterclaim
"People might not want to require extracurricular activities, ",Counterclaim
even thought it can improve social skills ,Counterclaim
although there are many reasons as to why we shouldnt force kids to participate in extracurricular activities there is also a good side to it. many kids who love playing sports and doing the yearbook would not be affected by this new rule because the school is basically asking them to participate in something they would have participated in either way. ,Counterclaim
Some might say that extracurricular activity's could help students meet new people or gain social skills ,Counterclaim
Some would say that students need to learn to work together and be a good person in general,Counterclaim
Reasons why students should have to take a extracurricular activity are it can help students become healthier. Another reason is if a students parents don't get off from work till a certain time they can have there child stay after school and do a extracurricular activity until they get off work and can pick them up. Also students might be behind in there work and if they have to do a extra curricular activity they can stay after school and get all caught up on there work. ,Counterclaim
"You may think, ""It's nice that the students can find a friend, but what if there is nothing they would like or want to participate in?""",Counterclaim
"Some may thing ""But what if the government doesn't want to support the schools in the adding of more classes?""",Counterclaim
" having a extracurricular activity can allow less time for homework, or can negatively effect you grades.",Counterclaim
"However, the specific decision of the principal should be changed as students may already participate in extracurricular activities not provided by the school. ",Counterclaim
Someone may argue that school clubs can make students more social and help them stay active. ,Counterclaim
"Some students do multiple after school classes a week, but this can be stressful at times. ",Counterclaim
But some people will probably say that kids need freedom and should not be forced to do extracurricular activity.,Counterclaim
"I dont think it is wrong sports are very good for you for example sports are good exercise and you could try something new, and you could even learn that you like a sport,",Counterclaim
I see how it could be good to put kids in new programs,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, a lot of schools are not making kids take an extracurricular activity. ",Counterclaim
Having to pick out a after school activity can be stressful when dont have a any hobbies or even know what your interested in. ,Counterclaim
"Yes, extracurricular activities are hard to do or may seem like a waste of time,",Counterclaim
But what if students donÃÂ´t like any of the activities.,Counterclaim
Some might say its better for kids to do after school activities ,Counterclaim
When you first decide you want to join a club it might be scary because you don't know anyone or which one to choose so you can fit in,Counterclaim
"People who support the principals idea may say things like ""the more activities, the better"", or ""now the students have things to do with their friends ",Counterclaim
but some students may really enjoy doing sports or extracurricular activities.,Counterclaim
"This is saying that there is alot of risk in going to go research venus.
",Counterclaim
But there are some dangers to exploring these planets ,Counterclaim
There are also many dangers that come when visiting Venus,Counterclaim
Even though the author states reasons why it is a worthy pursuit there are still dangers to it. ,Counterclaim
"Yes, it might be dangerous",Counterclaim
What he does not talk about well is the why. Why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. ,Counterclaim
"On the other hand the author doesn't give a solid reason for why studying Venus is worth it and despite the risks. ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors,""(paragraph 8).",Counterclaim
The author aslo doesn't give a sound explanation as to how the danger of heat can be overcome for enabling the trip to be successful ,Counterclaim
They could have totally messed up on the calculations of surviving on the planet and it might be a failure ,Counterclaim
 A spacecraft hasnt landed on Venus in 3 decades due to the harsh conditions. ,Counterclaim
"Although it is not the most persuasive support and idea he displays that Venus is a worthy pursiut,",Counterclaim
"He does not support this idea throughly, giving limited information to convice the reader of his claim. He only says it can last in challenging conditions for a limired amount of time, but does not mention any support, leaving silicon carbide as his weakest support on how using that, can convice people that Venus is a worthy pursit depsite the dangers it possesses. He uses only one fact, but not not give enough anaylsis to make his argument strong or very clear. ",Counterclaim
"While the author believes there are a number of dangers in the exploration,",Counterclaim
But I also think it's a bad idea to send people to Venus and study more about it.,Counterclaim
"However, there are still a few ways that the author tore down his own claims that he was making about the mission its self. ",Counterclaim
"Yes, Venus has a lot of risk ",Counterclaim
There are a lot of dangers when is comes to living on Venus ,Counterclaim
I think that we should not waste our time to explore Venus ,Counterclaim
Also even if there is dangerous,Counterclaim
NASA has came up with a ¨solution¨ of the problemof gaining knowledge of Venus which is for a vehicle to hover over Venus and scientists would safely observe the planet that way.,Counterclaim
"i know your thinking why would people wanna go there,",Counterclaim
"What would make the danger of going to Venus worth it? In paragraph four, the author states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once been the most Earth-like [...] a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.""",Counterclaim
"Do the dangers of Venus outweigh the reasons to study it? The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" belives they do not ",Counterclaim
"In the closing paragraph of the article they write, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likly lead out many intimidating endeavors."" ",Counterclaim
We could use spacecraft to hover over venus about 30 miles or so above it.,Counterclaim
"Are technology gets better throughout the years, so maybe one day well figure a way out to oustand that heat and pressure ",Counterclaim
In the artical the author sounds very confident about this exploration ,Counterclaim
even though it is dangerous ,Counterclaim
"The author could've included more evidence to support his view, but he did provide one piece of sufficient evidence. Paragraph 4 reads, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This piece shows that some scientists want to explore Venus for its ancient possible ability to explore life ",Counterclaim
". This may seem indisputable to many, however we need to consider, ""what are some other options for pursuing such a risky mission, while creating something in which can be both safe and scientifically productive?",Counterclaim
Although some may say that all missions to go to venus are failed and its dangerous,Counterclaim
Many people may say they dont want to risk peoples lifes or to scared of what could go wrong ,Counterclaim
"The author of the article mentions clearly in paragraph three the intolerable living conditions of the planet Venus. Although the author has knowledge of these dangers,",Counterclaim
However it is dangerous and that's the only thing that's stopping NASA from sending a human to Venus,Counterclaim
"Throughtout the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author presents infomation for exploring Venus being both beneficial and harmful,",Counterclaim
Some people may think studying Venus isn't a worthy persuit because of how dangerous it could be for astronomers to examine it ,Counterclaim
People also may think coming up with devices to make scientists float over the surface is putting them in a position of getting hurt due to all the fails that have happened,Counterclaim
"On the contrary, Venus does have large setbacks that could hold us back from doing so. Like the planets surface temperature, 800 degrees fahrenheit is a lot higher than any human can handle, along with 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets that create the atmosphere for the planet.",Counterclaim
Even if we were able to have a ship hover over the planet we would be able to see much becouse most froms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,Counterclaim
The athor states that Venus has proven many times before that it is not an easy planet to study.,Counterclaim
These dangers may seem like it isn't a worthy pursuit,Counterclaim
"The only bad thing about what they are trying to do, is the dangerous conditions.

Its far more extreme than what any human has encountered on Earth.",Counterclaim
"Their plans are to use a blimp-like vehicle that will withstand the great amount of pressure and heat. It will fly thirty miles above the Venusian landscape, avoiding any ground conditions that would do them harm. It would still be 170 degrees F., but they would have an abundance of solar energy, and the radiation woud not exceed Earth levels. ",Counterclaim
"While scientists believe that Venus was at one point like earth, there are some facts that show that it has the looks of earth in some ways.",Counterclaim
"The article says,""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.'' Which is great they are working on that,",Counterclaim
"But like everything, there is a down side to living so close to the sun.
",Counterclaim
" Although the author referred to the study being beneficial to man's sense of imagination and innovation,",Counterclaim
"On the contray, the author gives more background information than what good could come from studying Venus. The author states all the information that desscribes the atomosphere and what the surface of Venus is like but gives very little information that concerns the reason why Venus should be explored ",Counterclaim
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author shows a clear, all out passion torwards the study of the molten planet. ",Counterclaim
"I do understand why Scientists would like to go to Venus, it would be a great acheivement for humanity ",Counterclaim
" Here's my problem with the authors claims, and that is that they have no hard proof or that they don't go into detail. ",Counterclaim
venus is high radiated and very hot their atmospheric pressure is high. The thought of any person wanting to go their is dispicable because of such harsh conditions.,Counterclaim
doing so will take alot of tech we dont have yet,Counterclaim
"Finally, the author takes into thorough consideration that the temperatures and brutal lack of livable substance on the planet ",Counterclaim
"For one, he does state that yes, of course it is very dangerous studying Venus and it's suroundings due to all of the risky factors on the plantet ",Counterclaim
"
Although that would be great to find out, the dangers are so high on the planet that it would be almost impossible to figure out",Counterclaim
"Though there are certainly high risks that come with traveling to such a dangerous planet,",Counterclaim
The author of the article does mention how difficult it is to study Venus by bringing up the planet's harsh atmosphere in Paragraph 3 ,Counterclaim
 He does mention that those plans may have challenges fo their own in Paragraph 6.,Counterclaim
"but what about power, the temperature, and air pressure",Counterclaim
So then what about the danger of radiation well it turns out that that is also brought up.,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, the reasons to visit Venus are, dare I say, lacking ",Counterclaim
"The author provided solutions to these problems that scientists are working on,",Counterclaim
"I dont disagree that going to Venus will gain us insight on the planet, spark imagination, and create innovation",Counterclaim
"The big issue though is that the tempture gets really high like around 800 degrees for example it siads that ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volecanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightn skrikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""",Counterclaim
They think that many years ago that Venus was just like Earth but they have no evidence to support the claim. ,Counterclaim
The author supports further Venus expiditions because of the insight we would gain from it.,Counterclaim
The author brings up the idea of having the scientist float thirty miles or more above the surface.,Counterclaim
Even if he brings up points why we should still go there ,Counterclaim
The author also brings up that there could be a survivable soulution by having a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the landscapre. ,Counterclaim
The author then mentions that researchers are looking for innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute knowledge over Venus. ,Counterclaim
"Like any good argument, the author highlights some counter arguments, and then gives possible solutions. For example, the author explains the harsh conditions of Venus such as high temperature and high atmospheric pressure. The author even tells the reader that, ""no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours.""",Counterclaim
"However, the author is a bit off the mark when it comes to explaining why what we find on Venus can help humanity out. Although it states what we can find on Venus, and how it is Earth-like and the planet closest to Earth, ",Counterclaim
Many people may think that since Venus has 97 percent carbon dioxide and tht its over 800 degrees that it's not safe for people to travel because those are extreme measures the human body can not take.,Counterclaim
It is hard to study Venus,Counterclaim
"There are also many more things we need to study about Venus, that may not be so safe. Venus is the second planet to our sun, which may be too hot for humans to be on. This planet is a very challenging place to examine ",Counterclaim
"Even if the author builds the fact that it is currently impossible to send a manned mission to Venus,",Counterclaim
"After the author discussed about the dangers and challenges of Venus, readers may wonder why scientists would even bother to study such a life-less planet.",Counterclaim
"Venus, also known as the ""Evening Star"", since it is so easy to see at night, and our ""Sister Planet"", is a very difficult place to study. ",Counterclaim
 But because of the dense clouds not letting most light forms into the inner atmosphere it would hinder insight of the surface. Thus rendering the photography and videography unavailable. ,Counterclaim
Along with venus having good things; Venus can also have bad and dangerous things ,Counterclaim
"However, there is some evidence to support that the author is not completely on board with some things regarding the exploration of Venus",Counterclaim
"However, right after making that statement, the authors first sentence in paragraph 6, combats the idea that it is survivable for humans ",Counterclaim
The one thing the author does not write about is how much all of this is going to cost and who is going to pay for it.,Counterclaim
"In the introduction, the author is describing Venus and explaining how ""The Evening Star."" Is the nickname, but beyond that- paragraph 1 and 2 wasn't explaining why you should pursuit it. ",Counterclaim
"Yet one paragraph that is arguing with wanting to go to Venus is ""Each previous mission was unamed, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" ",Counterclaim
"Before this though, the author described how dangerous Venus has become and how it has almost become impossible for scientists to send a robot to the planet. ",Counterclaim
"Although these are all fair reasons to want to visit Venus once again, astronomers have to keep in mind all of the negative characteristics that will set their exploration behind.",Counterclaim
They eventually hit the oppostition and shows the down fall with NASA's great plan.,Counterclaim
"Throughout the story the author does list at least one benefit to exploring Venus. In the story he writes, "" it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Yes i can agree that would be a great reason to explore Venus,",Counterclaim
"However, they arent working out so well as a vehicle like this would prevent them from collecting any rocks or gases to bring back and research.",Counterclaim
This is to explain that the dangers of going to Venus far outweigh the saftey.,Counterclaim
"Although there are many valuable reasons as to why Venus is worth studying for, the author includes some evidence that indicate why Venus exploration is not succeeding as well.",Counterclaim
Yes there are many risks to going to Venus and here is why we shouldn't ,Counterclaim
"In other hand, I believe this has to be limited to protect individual human rights",Counterclaim
them again we wouldnt need to invest in this if students spoke up about what they needed and whats going on,Counterclaim
The school board or government shoudnt have to invest in the Facial Action Coding System if teachers take the time and talk to their students,Counterclaim
"However, there is a downside to the system. If the computer is doing all the teaching, why would we need teachers? Kids would start to lose the interest in their teachers. ",Counterclaim
"Even with all these benefits, there are also some flaws to the idea of having this program on the computers.",Counterclaim
"Another flaw to this idea is how students act. Some students will be able to take this program seriously, other students may be childish about it.",Counterclaim
Another problem that students may come across is the teacher.,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, what could the Facial Action Coding System be useful for in classrooms? Students may be able to use this feature in physiciatry studies",Counterclaim
"The author states that Dr. Huang predicts, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" and then goes on to talk about how the computer would modify the lessons for the student. ",Counterclaim
"But also the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions can help, but if the person wants to ",Counterclaim
"Although some people may think that the Facial Action Coding System is a phony,",Counterclaim
"Some people may disagree with this and think that a computer does not have all of the resources that students need to understand a lesson. Though some people may think that face-to-face learning is more effective,",Counterclaim
"People may disagree with that and say that not all facial expressions are the same,",Counterclaim
The main reason why this is creepy to me is it reminds me of the Movie Tremator.,Counterclaim
Technology could not be this percise and acurate to say the EXACT number of ehat emotion your feeling.,Counterclaim
Although it might be a very fun thing to do it might also not be the best,Counterclaim
On the other hand it can make kids feel uncomforable. most kids don't like to talk about their problems.,Counterclaim
"In the other hand in paragraph 6 when the author stated ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor",Counterclaim
"
Although there is no definite way to ensure that students will completely understand the things they are taught,",Counterclaim
But i also have a good thought on technology reading people faces .,Counterclaim
Another reason i like the tecgnology reading people expressions is because police can use the computer.,Counterclaim
"However, this could also be a bad idea.",Counterclaim
Although this would not always be 100% accurate,Counterclaim
You might not be the mood for anything and the computer can tell when your bored or not feeling anything it will modify the way it work so you will be in a better mood i think its great.,Counterclaim
 But another think would be why would we need this in class instead of using money for this technology they should fix the schools and bring more learning experiences around the country instead of wasting money to see how somebody is feeling ,Counterclaim
"However, despite the possible benefits facial analysis could provide online classrooms,",Counterclaim
Counterarguments might say that online classrooms could keep images of faces secret and secure ,Counterclaim
People might argue that users should educate themselves on how the system works before even considering buying the product ,Counterclaim
"Humans, as D'Alto states, indeed ""perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. ",Counterclaim
"Yes, we humans are able to detect when someone is feeling bad,",Counterclaim
The only slight flaw that could go against this facial software is that computers cannot detect genuine emotion. Such as a person hiding certain emotions that are not shown on a facial expression.,Counterclaim
Some people may think this new technology may be an awesome technology,Counterclaim
Yeah it may be awesome to other people,Counterclaim
Yea it might have some good sides to it for crimes and all that,Counterclaim
"Although the use of the Facial Acyion Coding System for the teacher and the learning of the students, it would be an invasion of privacy.",Counterclaim
"Yes, some of the arguments in the article can be good like, "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.""",Counterclaim
But again i think it will be good for to be at school because when the students walks in the classroom they can just have them come to the computer and scan them to make sure they are having a good day and nothing is bothring them ,Counterclaim
All tho they trying to help the children out and make them better or whatever they trying to do its not not worth paying alot of money for a mixed emotion computer when you can just send them to they soical worker ,Counterclaim
I understand that the machines can modify lessons like an effective human instructor or it can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or even video sergery which is pretty amazing.,Counterclaim
I'm highly pro-technology,Counterclaim
One raeson I think wde shouldn't have them in a class room is becasue it will distact kids because it'll have the kids focused on technology instead of learning thats the only reason i think we shouldn't have them. ,Counterclaim
"eventhough it may not seem praticle to use this technology,",Counterclaim
"While this system will have many down sides such as cost, people messing with it, and a lot of complants.",Counterclaim
"Yes you can see how that person is ""feeling by looking at their face,""

but some people can fake a smile to hide whats going on inside, some people are just scared to let their feeling out because they are worried someone it going to hurt them. ",Counterclaim
"There are multiple reasons that the new software will not be beneficial to students in the classroom, however, there are a couple reasons that the technology will be valuable. In the passage it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. ",Counterclaim
"Later in the passage it says, ""Empathy (feeling someone elses emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions."" ",Counterclaim
The progam still has alot of flaws ,Counterclaim
Well the robot could malfunction in the middle of class and and go roge and start herting people.,Counterclaim
"But of course the cost of the product would be a quite big infact, maybe to big for distribution, whichcan lead to problems later on. ",Counterclaim
 Sure the teacher could use this technology to teach students about how advanced the humans have become but.. ,Counterclaim
But that dosen't mean that you should not let them try it.,Counterclaim
"The main con is that the machine may take time to read a face and by the time it has been read, the emotion can change. Also, this technology can be expensive, especially for a school with hundreds or even thousands of students ",Counterclaim
One thing that I don't like about the system is that someone could use it on me and then someone ,Counterclaim
" However this could be really helpful to someone like a mental therepist, ",Counterclaim
I can see why many people wouldn't like it in thier classroom though. Maybe the teacher doesn't like art. Or maybe they don't know that much about art.,Counterclaim
Some peolpe don't like it mabye it's because they're the stress ones that need help and think that no one cares and is to scared to show they're depress and they rather keep to them self.,Counterclaim
"However, not to say that the software could potentially read the emotions of others wrong, because in some cases humans tend to have a look on their face that contradicts their actual emotion ",Counterclaim
Some people might say that the (FACS) is not valuable,Counterclaim
"First, I would like to say that this is a really good topic the author brings forth to the table,",Counterclaim
"Lastly, I would like to say that this point of view that the author is taking is a very good start,",Counterclaim
I am sure there are some upsides to this ,Counterclaim
"
Some people may argue this program is taking away from a teachers job or is could be used for the wrong things.",Counterclaim
"With this being said, kids can also minipulate the software by acting sad or angry to try to weaken the strangth of the computer based assignment.
",Counterclaim
You could also look at someone and maybe guess how they are feeling ,Counterclaim
In some cases it can be used for people in the hospital,Counterclaim
Some students might not be comfortable with their face being scanned ,Counterclaim
"Yes, it might get distracting at times for some people",Counterclaim
While people agree and disagree with this idea the opposition has some good points,Counterclaim
By knowing what people are feeling it could effect the mental state of the mind and body and not cause stress. ,Counterclaim
This new technology advancement would be able to recognize one's emotions but we can't always rely on technology.,Counterclaim
"This technology can also be misleadng, ",Counterclaim
"But is the program really needed , can the teacheers not just simply come and help te students out?",Counterclaim
I know that there are some down falls to this technology what if the student or the person doesn't have a problem and just has a face that makes it look like he/she has a problem.,Counterclaim
On the other hand if it can see what you really are thinking than maybe it is a little valuable to the students and teahcers at school. So it really depends on how the technology works to really know if it's valuable or not. ,Counterclaim
There are some cons to the F.A.C.S system right now though ,Counterclaim
The muscles in our face does say a lot about the emotions we are feeling.,Counterclaim
"Having that tecnology would be benifical in other thing instead of a classroom like for the police for interigating other people, in court to see if other people are lying. So the tecnology does have some benifits",Counterclaim
i get why some people dont tell their real feelings because they might not want them to see them down.,Counterclaim
but i know most of them well not enjoy or like it at all. ,Counterclaim
 I find it kind of creepy that it knows your face and the way you feel ,Counterclaim
I also feel that this is invading someones personal space. ,Counterclaim
"I dont think computers and humans need to communicate but, I do think humans need to communicate with other humans.",Counterclaim
 I'm not saying that this type of technology is bad,Counterclaim
"Even with all of these negatives, there are some positives in that some genuinely sad individuals using this software can be cheered up and will actually begin to pay attention to their screens. This software has many negatives but at the same time might actually be used for good in schools that can afford it and still have money left over.",Counterclaim
A reason why this is bad is due to people and their privacy.,Counterclaim
Also another reason why this is bad is the portablity of this technology ,Counterclaim
Another bad reason for this is becuase people could fake their emotions ,Counterclaim
"Lastly, my final reason is how hard it will be to access this tech.",Counterclaim
But trust me computers would be very valuable in classrooms on the positive side,Counterclaim
 There are concerns about privacy to a computer tracking and watching you the moment you get on. ,Counterclaim
Would set off signs that the computer measures and calculates how and what you are feeling. Also worry about privacy of students and teachers a machine watching you the moment you get on. That keeps a record of how long you were on and what you were doing of course most computers already do that. ,Counterclaim
"Altough tis could serve as a disadvantage to some people, by people knowing their buissness and knowing if they are lying or not ",Counterclaim
but if they use it to much and make it to logical we could lose sight of how to properly use it ,Counterclaim
although this technology could help letting teachers know how their emotionally feeling ,Counterclaim
A reason it may not be Valuble is people just need privacy ,Counterclaim
There will be people against the idea because they would feel vulnerable with a computer actually reading their emotions ,Counterclaim
"Also, this technology isn't what probably students want in a classroom because",Counterclaim
"The article states, "" ""A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Huang predicts.""Then it could modify the lesson, like the effective human instructor."" ",Counterclaim
"Using this technology may mean that a lot of classroom learning will need to be completed on computers,",Counterclaim
There is a downfall to all this greatness ,Counterclaim
but The technolgy itself may be help at identifying students emotion,Counterclaim
Although this is a great tool to use when trying to teach students it is probably very expensive to have it installed into computers for students nationwide ,Counterclaim
Even though there are some down sides to using Facial Action Coding System,Counterclaim
"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. with this said it may become frustrating or irritating to the student with the constant changes.",Counterclaim
There may be some science in this FACS (Facial Action Coding System) but this tech can be used somewhere else that someone may find it useful like if someone want to know if the president is making a fake emotion pretending that he is happy. ,Counterclaim
Now the thing about the facial recognition being in a classroom might make it more interesting. It there was a way to make school more interesting than that would be great. I'm not sure how far it would go to make the students happy. It says that it could modify the lesson like an efective human instructor ,Counterclaim
"It says that it would be able to tell if I am confused which is a good thing. That way I wouldn't have to ask the teacher to come help me. They would just know and come help me,",Counterclaim
.This would also kind of do good in a classroom to help out confused kids when there to shy to ask for help ,Counterclaim
The Facial Action Coding System is definetly an amazing invention to computers and reading facial expressions. Although it is a great invention ,Counterclaim
But to be on the safe side we can tell how people are doing because some people be lying about how they feel. ,Counterclaim
" it can be usefull but, can also be a disadvatage ",Counterclaim
"
The reason why we should use this is that it will help us cut down all the sucides and will help us make a lot more people happy.",Counterclaim
The reason why we need this is to help us get more with people trying to endanger them and to make sure everyone can feel better ,Counterclaim
Although it would be interesting to see what the students are feeling during a lesson. ,Counterclaim
now some people believe that we should have robots to help us etc ,Counterclaim
A drawback to having the technology in the classroom could mean that we could give off the wrong emotions and confuse the computer it self.,Counterclaim
"Another drawback would be that in paragraph seven it states ""Your home PC can't handle the comples algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. ",Counterclaim
"Another set back would be People who suffer from Depression, Bipolar or PTSD can change emotions constantly and quickly. ",Counterclaim
"Some may disagree with the opionion of having this technology used in classrooms. Others may say that no matter the lesson, the student could just simply be tired or un-interested in learning.",Counterclaim
Those who believe that this computer technology is not valued in classrooms could think that the software might not work effectivley.,Counterclaim
"Initally one may think that this technology is redundant and that a teacher could just help the student, and that it may be invading the students privacy. ",Counterclaim
The only problem I could see come about is security. I mean i wouldnt want some program judging my facial expressions 24/7 ,Counterclaim
"Dr. Haung predicted that it would help for video surgery, ",Counterclaim
There is one good thing about this emtional problem ,Counterclaim
"Everyone will not think this program is safe, and is envading privacy. ",Counterclaim
"Yet this is sadly still not at the point where every if any teachers can have this beacuse ""your home PC can't handle the complex algorithims"" said Dr. Huang. So it wil be a while untill we each have powerfull enough softwhere to use it or they can simplify it down to be downloaded on a regualr PC which most Americans own.",Counterclaim
Some may argue that using this technology isn't fair to the students. That students emotions shouldn't be read by a computer.,Counterclaim
"Yes, it would make people lose their jobs and bore the other students who already understand the topic",Counterclaim
"From the ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" article by Nick D'Alto, some perks it is able to include from this is only the idea of face reconition allowing ads to know whether you are smiling or frowning at the ad to know whether to keep ads like that or move on with new ones.",Counterclaim
Another thing is it being able to change a lesson to suit a students emotions if they are feeling confused or bored. This could be a good thing,Counterclaim
Technology that can recognize emotions in a class room could be used to help students who are bored or confused. The ability to tell when someone is bored or lost is a very valuable tool for a teacher.,Counterclaim
The only downside would be that that is two much time on computers and cell phones which arent good for the kids health,Counterclaim
Some people will argue that students won't be truthful and they will just make it a joke ,Counterclaim
Some people might think this would be perfect for teachers ,Counterclaim
"Some people would argue that it is not a good idea beacuse what if some students dont want the computer to tell waht ther felling, they would think it was a little weird.",Counterclaim
In that case the computer would make it harder for that paiticular student to learn the material given to them. ,Counterclaim
"Although, Many people believe the tool is invasive,",Counterclaim
Yes this way of using FACS is a little creepy and it may be a violtinon of our right,Counterclaim
I can kind of see where this could be interupting your privacy,Counterclaim
This technology could be useful ,Counterclaim
"However, on the technological aspect, how can one know how reliable a computer is on detecting somebody's facial expression?",Counterclaim
"Many parents or administrators may not agree that this sounds real or possible, ",Counterclaim
"Although this would be really great, many people could say that not all students have the same feelings about things so if a teacher changed his or her lesson based on one student, then some of the other students might not be as engaged or delighted.",Counterclaim
There can be arguements made that students are already watched by a camera or a computer at all times. ,Counterclaim
This article also shows how this technology can benefit the learning of the students. ,Counterclaim
"But, than i'm against because how can the computer see what all the student are feeling like?",Counterclaim
I don't think its a bad idead at i think its very cool and neat how it works ,Counterclaim
"However, with programs such as Google, the computer just would not be necessary.",Counterclaim
"But how can a computer capture someone's emotions if they have their hand over their face or their head down? They simply can't help that type of situation. Also, humans are very complex creatures.",Counterclaim
"The FACS can be cool at certain part in life,",Counterclaim
It does benefit a liitle bit by changing stuff the computer to change our mood.,Counterclaim
"Furthermore, I think that this technology could be very helpful to high school counselors.",Counterclaim
Keeping in mind that some student would not want their emotional expressions being read due to their privacy.,Counterclaim
The technology seems like it would be very expensive though.,Counterclaim
Another thing is sometimes people may not want their emotions read.,Counterclaim
"Now some might think other wise because of alot of problems that could possibly go wrong with it such as the cost of that software, If the software makes any mistakes, and weather or not the software would work for every student",Counterclaim
A reason you may not want this technology in your classroom is because it can't detect nonverbal communication.,Counterclaim
That is a counter arguement someone can make . What if my facial expression is showing one thing but im feeling a different way ,Counterclaim
But this could also take many jobs away ruining the carrer of a teacher ,Counterclaim
Another person could say it is vaulable to help students and keep them entertained in a lesson and switch it up a bit.,Counterclaim
Although this may be expensive and students will not like a computer to read their emotions because it would be weird for them and it also may be unconterfull for students having a computer to just say their feelings in front of a class. ,Counterclaim
The Facial Action Coding System ( FACS) is a great idea for schools as I said earlier but I do not see how it could help in other things.,Counterclaim
However this program could be useful for diegosing depression and stats that doctors still have trouble finding ,Counterclaim
It could also become a distraction for the students.,Counterclaim
But also it can be very bad to read other peoples emotions because it can become very personal.,Counterclaim
Then you have your cons. This technology might not always be precise and at some point this could lead to problems when trying to solve a serious situation. ,Counterclaim
"But how accurate is this new software, and how do we know we can rely on it? ",Counterclaim
"The Facial Action Coding System is seemly flawless with many positive outlooks on what is instore for us in the futrue, but has two big questions sitting on its shoulders. How can we rely on this system? And how do we know that this is even an accurate reading?",Counterclaim
Although this machine would be great to have in schools it could be taken as a privacy issue,Counterclaim
"Facial muscles are obviously an important item in this. If the technology could not identify the way your facial muscles move, then the technology would not work.",Counterclaim
This could be useful to determine pictures and see how they were feeling at the time of the picture. ,Counterclaim
"This device could become useful to see how people felt in movies, books, or even paintings.",Counterclaim
Again it may be helpful with things back then,Counterclaim
This technology does sound helpful in the fact that it could gauge the state of mind of a student and help a teacher adjust their teaching methods to accomodate and keep their students students on track. ,Counterclaim
"Although some may say emotion may not be read properly or that emotions are too complex to be read through a few muscles and only six options,",Counterclaim
Maybe you could tell hows your friend is feeling by looking at them. ,Counterclaim
The bad things about the emotion detecting system is that it could mess up some how and it would tell the teacher that this kid is sad but he is happy.,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, yes this new facial technology is not nessary. People often say teacher can read their students facial expersstions just fine without technology; ",Counterclaim
"I do support this but ; however, there is some things about this that do concern me as a student. Some students could be angered by the use of this new technology and want their old lesson plans back",Counterclaim
I understand that the system could increase test scores and grade averages,Counterclaim
"I can see the positive side of this technology. The artuicle talks about how it can react and change ads based on your face, and even modify lesson plans for children in school,",Counterclaim
"But for some people they don't need that because we can tell others people facial expressions by just looking at them clearly, which it true.",Counterclaim
"I know some of my peers do not enjoy sharing emotions or their opinions on certain situations with people they are not familiar with, and I am the exact same way, ",Counterclaim
One downside to this machine is that. What if they get the emotions wrong?,Counterclaim
"Now, I am not saying that FACS would not be helpful in some cases ",Counterclaim
"Maybe in a college where you want to be a consuler or something along those lines it would be a good thing to have to teach you how to read others emotions better,",Counterclaim
" the only downside is that you can not have it on your laptop, the text states, ""Your home PC can't handles the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" ",Counterclaim
 Maybe they do have a good idea and maybe it really could help,Counterclaim
because yeah it would be cool to see peoples emotions and see how people are feeling,Counterclaim
A lot of people would say no to this technology because they are getting checked by a computer ,Counterclaim
Propponents may say people can easily put on false emotions ,Counterclaim
Yes I do think it's valuable but at the same time I dont agree with it because theres such a thing called privcy,Counterclaim
" I know thats not all the feelings in mona Lisa's face, there ahs to be more to it, there always is. Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists but what if they are wrong?",Counterclaim
" but it can have controversial problems, because some parents may not want a computer to read their childrens emotions, or they can think that is not a good thing that a computer can read your face and later they can use the picture of the face for other things ",Counterclaim
The cons might be that the the parents may not like the idea that a computer is reading the emotions of their kids ,Counterclaim
Parents probably disagree about using technology when showing their emotions. Not just parents but maybe some students wouldn't like it either,Counterclaim
"However, the downside to using the facial action coding system is that it can malfunction at ny given time. The facial action coding system seems like a creepy concept ",Counterclaim
 on the other hand the schools would have to purchase and learn how to use the complex system. ,Counterclaim
If this technolgy was used in the classroom it would be hard for every school to use it.,Counterclaim
"But also I do feel students have a choice, a choice that means if they want to have their face's read or not. If the student doesn't want their face to be read, then so be it. If the student is willing to have their face read, then so be it. ",Counterclaim
On the other hand using technology is kind of a good idea for people that have trouble showing their feelings and emotions are the kind of people that would us technology ,Counterclaim
"But the down side of this is that it can only recognize certain emotions such as happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. But what if you have a diffrent emotion than that then what will the computer do when that happens just keep going how it is or will it try something new.",Counterclaim
Using this type of technology can help our courts determine wether a criminal is guilty or innocent.,Counterclaim
"We could use this in way to get people out of danger, such Zologist. they feed and tame animal to be less aggressive, if this computer can detect emotion, then it can help avoid attacks from wild animals. ",Counterclaim
" Even though, some may think that, that is the most stupiest thing ever to be told. Nobody in this day and age is very open with each other ",Counterclaim
Using this techonolgy ti read emotional expressions of student in the classroom it is valuable because when a students is feeling down or depress you would know so you could help them.,Counterclaim
"Using the techonolgy to read emotional expressions, some people will love it ",Counterclaim
The thing I do like abot the the solfware is that it can help alot of kids that wasn't tought right or just don't get certain things ,Counterclaim
The face scanning application could however get things wrong and make the wrong asuption of how someone is feeling.,Counterclaim
I mean don't get me wrong it a good tool it see people emotional . ,Counterclaim
Some may say that this system would be an invasion of privacy for the students ,Counterclaim
The teacher would probably say that it would be useful for that technology. Some students probably wouldn't mine,Counterclaim
"That quote sounds like its better than a teacher, because it can read the emotions and tell when the students get bored so they can change it. ",Counterclaim
"Towards the end of the text, they said they used it for a theatre thing. That is an appropriate place to use it, because you are supposed to show a lot of emotions there.",Counterclaim
"even though this could have some really great benefits to it, it could also have some really bad ones.",Counterclaim
"in the second paragraph it says that we or computer can ""calculate"" our emotions ",Counterclaim
"Even with that sanificant factor of helping children out with there emotions, there is also some cons about have this system. Facial Action Coding System could almost make the parents a bit worried about there children and be wondering would it could be doing ",Counterclaim
Another con is that the system could malfunction. ,Counterclaim
"In comparison, others might say FACS technology should be used on people.",Counterclaim
"Although this technology sounds great and seems like it has no flaws or problems, it does. ",Counterclaim
"The only negative aspect of Dr. Huangs software would be the cost of installation,",Counterclaim
"There is a good side that I see to all if this as well too.

For example, it could be used to help a person who is depressed or really sad.",Counterclaim
"In now day technology is develope more and more, somtime they can be usefull ",Counterclaim
"In the artical its says "" Perhaps Dr. Huangs's emotion algorithms are different sort of "" Da Vinci Code"" which mean that they probable have not figured it out yet which can lead to having wrong answers.
",Counterclaim
"In some ideas I agree with the article is when in the article it said ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" I agree on that statement; to use this new technology for educational purposes",Counterclaim
 It also a good idea to use it when someoone is really depressed about something and if you feel something is gonna happen to the person and you can tell an adult to help with the problem.,Counterclaim
You see them everyday you already know how they are ,Counterclaim
"Although it may be difficult to detect certain emotions of a student and encourage them to fully express them,",Counterclaim
"One downside is that it can give out a students business and if like a student is sad, it can become a joke to the other students and make that student even more sad.",Counterclaim
this would bring alot of contriversy yes ,Counterclaim
"Although you might think it is strange to have a computer know exactly how you are feeling when you sit down at in front of it.
",Counterclaim
But it could be a good thing for the school because it could help the school know if the kid was upset or bad. ,Counterclaim
"Computers may have a code that help identify the facial expressions, but some humans don't really show much facial expression on how they are feeling.",Counterclaim
"Although some may ask, why dont you just ask us how we feel in this class ",Counterclaim
"Yeah, it might be cool to see how one of your friends if feeling,",Counterclaim
"""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'""(D'Alto).",Counterclaim
"This System seem's like it would be cool to use on you'r phone, or with a group of friend's",Counterclaim
"Though I am not for this technology for the fact that we do not need a machine or computer telling us what state of emotion were in,",Counterclaim
but from other people perspectives i can totally see how this is a total invading of privacy because we all have secrects and we dont want people knowing if were depressed or sad and alot of people dont like to communicate or open with anyone and also what if things get passed around about you being depressed the generatin today are bullys so i can see someone making fun of someone for being depressed. ,Counterclaim
"I understand that some people aren't natural psychologists, and don't know how to read emotions.",Counterclaim
My only problems is time. If the programs take an hour or more plus time you can't really act on the problem imediatly.,Counterclaim
another problem i could see is can it take one face or a whole class room of faces.,Counterclaim
"However, some people may read this article and see a few problems with it.

They may wonder how a computer can analyze everybody's facial expressions, if everybody's facial expressions are slightly different. ",Counterclaim
"the humans can't identify emotion from the face muscles,",Counterclaim
A bad thing about this computer would be for teachers,Counterclaim
However there are also drawbacks to using a computer software to read people's emotions. ,Counterclaim
A possible downside to this is cost effectiveness. The question of is the cost really worth it whenever there are already people in the world that can do the same thing. ,Counterclaim
A downside to this software is the loss of jobs for teachers as well as the reliance on technology. ,Counterclaim
The only negative about this is that the software won't recognize if you're smiling about the video you just watched or the ad that pops up. ,Counterclaim
But there could also be some down fall to it.,Counterclaim
Then again some people would think that its weird to have a computer watching your face 24/7,Counterclaim
This technology does have it´s cons. Reading the emotions of the students could be seen as a breach of their privicy. Not all students want everyone to know how they feel and would like to keep it to themselves. ,Counterclaim
"Even if a school had the funds to buy a computer that could process the data quickly enough to be useful,",Counterclaim
it would be awesome to scan faces but is it even worth to pay?,Counterclaim
Now if it was for an expermint to see how you are really feeling then go ahead,Counterclaim
 Dont get me wrong though . Its quiet an amazing work for actresses that are willing to improve their acting skills; It has quiet pontiental that they invented a 3-D computer to identify mixed emotions. ,Counterclaim
Now affording these in classrooms might be a big issue because they will be overpriced for schools to even have some if any.,Counterclaim
" It may be true that some children might not want people to know about this, that they may want to hide it.",Counterclaim
Some pros are probably will lower the displin in school and less viilents.,Counterclaim
 Many others may not agree with this technology because they don't want help nor do they want their emotions being able to be detected.,Counterclaim
"However, this technology is still slightly new and probably expensive. ",Counterclaim
Even though it seems to work very well it still can be fooled. ,Counterclaim
Some might argue that these computers might be a useful tool for counselors in schools ,Counterclaim
But it can also have some down sides.,Counterclaim
If it can do this. This thing will be ahead in technology and clear a path for us in the near furture ,Counterclaim
This system could be valuable but some people may see it different.,Counterclaim
 According to Prof. Thomas Huang this device can recognize the subtle facial movements humans use to express how humans feel.,Counterclaim
but maybe for some students it will be cool getting their faces read by a computer program. ,Counterclaim
I am not saying that when we want to search about emotions through technology there should not be anything on it.,Counterclaim
"On the oppisite end, this technology could not help the students or teachers at all ",Counterclaim
"However, having a Facial Action Coding System could be a bad idea because it would not give student's the kind of action and discpline they would have with a human teacher.",Counterclaim
people still have their rights and beliefs and you would be crossing the line in my opinion if you were to believe this idea.,Counterclaim
 But sometimes its true the Facial Action Coding System might be true,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, sometimes people want their emotions to be private and do not want other people to know what they are thinking ",Counterclaim
Not only do I think its some what personal but it do sound pretty intersting at the same time.,Counterclaim
Not everyone would wanna feel like getting on a computer checking to see if there happy or not.,Counterclaim
maybe it will help classes and maybe help advance students to a better grade or maybe even get them somewhere were they feel intrigued in,Counterclaim
"However, teachers may find this approach helpful. ",Counterclaim
Of course it could be helpful to get students more engaged in their learning,Counterclaim
but some people might not like that because they might be contused or bored,Counterclaim
"you have to think about the other sied of this argumint some you might be mad a some one else or be upset about some thing else and the computor might think you are upset with the lesson a chang it and everyone shows there emotions deffrint so how would the conpter know how you show yours ,",Counterclaim
While there are many positives to this technology some might argue that computers cannot actually calculate human emotion. They argue that human emotion is not somehting that can or should be understood because it would ruin the entirety of feeling certain ways.,Counterclaim
"
On the other hand it could help you like if some one was thinking of some thing and you could not help them or dont know if to do somthing or not ",Counterclaim
But one reason why I dont know about it because one day you can be mad in not let no one know . Or want somebody to know whats going on with you.,Counterclaim
"
On the other hand, having this added onto a online school, or even on some online learning website could help",Counterclaim
"A computer in a class constantly scanning students' faces could become a distraction, ",Counterclaim
Although it might be helpful in other ways than in a classroom ,Counterclaim
"Although that statement is true,",Counterclaim
But how do you get the others to believe thats theres not. Not everyone was satisfied ,Counterclaim
"Some people think the face is ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars",Counterclaim
there are some people belive that aliens do egsist and that the aliens did this face,Counterclaim
Another thing people are saying is that the NASA is hiding things from the public ,Counterclaim
" This excerpt from the article states that many people believe that NASA is hiding something from the public, something that they don't want everyone to know about.",Counterclaim
Some say that it was too cloudy to see any markings.,Counterclaim
Some people might say that NASA would rather hide evidence of life on Mars ,Counterclaim
"People started to have debates about the picture and what it could have ment. ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence pof life on Mars."" The others are trying to protect it so NASA could be a little bit safer. The picture did look like an Egyptian Pharaoh ",Counterclaim
"People can asume it is a human's face because it look likes it. Another thing is that there is human's face on it, can mean life on the planet, Mars. Also the rock or the artifact does have an Egyptian Pharoah, it could mean a human was at one point up there. It probably is possible to have civilization on Mars. ",Counterclaim
"Second, now to the conspiracy theorists, they think there was life on Mars like aliens. Anything is possible for one so they can't be entirely incorrect because even a few scientists got to thinking about the Face of Mars could be an alien too. ",Counterclaim
"Therefore, the conspiracy theorists may have some thoughts that make NASA ponder about ",Counterclaim
The lack of evidence of life on Mars led people to also believe that NASA was withholding information regarding aliens or other life forms. ,Counterclaim
Conspiracy theorists often try to confuse the public by saying that NASA is trying to hide Mars.,Counterclaim
"Of course, people still weren't satisfied. ",Counterclaim
"But, there are people that think our conclusion to this is a conspiracy theory. ",Counterclaim
"On the other side of things, there were many conspiracy theorists that questioned NASA's claim. ",Counterclaim
People belive there just covering it up so pople wont know about it.,Counterclaim
"In paragraph two it says, ""The sensation of the face was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa."" The conspiracy theorists think otherwise.",Counterclaim
"The Face on Mars was a very popular symbol for the alien conspirators, because they thought that the picture gave solid proof of aliens clearly doing work on the planet Mars ",Counterclaim
yet the public wasn't satisfied saying how the camera couldn't spot the face out because it was a cloudy time of the year for Mars.,Counterclaim
"There are many conspiracy theorists that claim we are trying to hide something, such as saying aliens made the Face. In the article it says

"" evidence that NASA would rather hide ",Counterclaim
People who believe it was made by aliens say that for many reason.,Counterclaim
Many would say that the aliens didn't want us to knw they exist,Counterclaim
Yet many people would believe living organisms on Mars and I can agree with that if they have fantastic reasoning to their theory.,Counterclaim
"In 1976, from the photograph, we can say that yes, it does look like a face.",Counterclaim
"One may argue that it is possibly a sign of alien life on Mars. They might say that the fact that it does look like a face could mean it was aliens who made it. Maybe they'd argue, ""The timing wasn't right. You can't see all the details.""",Counterclaim
Now I do understand why some people might say that it looks like it has been created by aliens cause it does look like a real face. ,Counterclaim
"""But how could it be natural, the odds of that happening are like one in a million.""",Counterclaim
"""How could you be so selfish to say that everthing on earth are the only living things in the universe, and by the way, there isn't anything wrong with me in the head, there might be with you if you are that selfish. I thought youre Mother raised you right."" ",Counterclaim
"there could be something like that out there, and it is not obserd or...""",Counterclaim
"Some might believe that the so called ""alien artifact"" was lefted behind by aliens",Counterclaim
"As stated before, many people, including scientists, believe that the Face on Mars is an alien artifact and here are their reasons why ",Counterclaim
"Conspiracy theorists believe that the Face is ""bona-fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide.""",Counterclaim
"However, the face could be have been maded by aliens.",Counterclaim

"Perhaps alien markings were by haze, skeptics claim ",Counterclaim
"Skeptics said ""alien markings were hidden by haze.""",Counterclaim
"Many poeple, however will still ask for more evidence that the landform is not alien artifact. ",Counterclaim
"While many people continue to believe that the face is proof of aliens,",Counterclaim
It may look like a face,Counterclaim
Most theorists claim it appears to be an Egyptian Pharoh. The theorists also claim that the martians built the pyramids. It's a theory but it might be possible.,Counterclaim
CA: Aliens could have made the Face as a siblimal message. ,Counterclaim
"Some people, like conspiracy theorists, say that it's evidence of alien life that NASA has hidden from the public ",Counterclaim
Some say that the scientists used a digital three image camera. ,Counterclaim
Some people might say that NASA is just trying to hide the alain life,Counterclaim
"some people still find ways to argue. These people might say ""the markings were hidden under the haze",Counterclaim
"Some people might say that when the picture was taken of the ""face"" in 1998 that it was probably cloudy that day and some alien markings were probably just covered up by the clouds.",Counterclaim
Most people have been saying that this face was created by aliens but i dont think so ,Counterclaim
It is possible that aliens exist and I don't doubt that they live without of our reach,Counterclaim
but skeptics a different thing. That pobably aliens makings were being hidden by the haze. ,Counterclaim
"Some conspiracy theorists like to think that there actually is life on Mars, and that's fine, but their reasoning is not credible and make believe. In the story it states ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.""",Counterclaim
Although some said that the alien markings might have been hidden by haze ,Counterclaim
People thought that the face was formed by alieans because they thought that there was life on Mars.,Counterclaim
"Everyone who thought it was made by alieans even though it wasn't, was not satisfied. I think they were not satisfied because they have thought since 1976 that it was really formed by alieans. ",Counterclaim
Although our defenders of our budget and some of us certainly wish there was a form of life on Mars. ,Counterclaim
"Don't get me wrong. I do believe that it looks like a person, or alien ",Counterclaim
However some alien conspiratists believe that there might have been a chance of alien life.,Counterclaim
Some of you say that the alien markings are hidden behind the wispy clouds.,Counterclaim
Not everyone was convinced it was just a landform. Many people still thought it had something to do with aliens,Counterclaim
Several people do belive it was created by aliens though.,Counterclaim
But contrary to what NASA believes there are were other people who said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by haze. ,Counterclaim
They might argue that im wrong because they might say that why will they need the technology and they might say like well we already have a picture and its a face. ,Counterclaim
"""But that picture wasn't very clear at all, which could mean alien markings were hidden by haze""",Counterclaim
"""But how do we know you're not just hiding things from us?"" ",Counterclaim
The author also states that people think the image or the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.,Counterclaim
In response to what I said my colleague had some things to say to try and disprove me. Due to my colleague believing in superstition and conspiracies he believed NASA and the government are hiding the truth from us.,Counterclaim
"There were some people out there who didn't belive it, said it was probably fake and that we were just trying to scare people into thinking aliens were real.",Counterclaim
"Some scientists think that the ""face"" could also have been an alien artifact. ",Counterclaim
"However, some people think that this could be an actule human life form on Mars ",Counterclaim
Some critics may argue that the landform is not like the others;,Counterclaim
"The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" ",Counterclaim
Others still thought it was a face. Those people thought that because of what the article says in parargraph 11. ,Counterclaim
NASA on the other hand and says there is likelyness of a human face. They also believe it is an alien artifac ,Counterclaim
"Although, I do understand why people could believe the ""face"" was built by aliens. It does look like it could be a monument, like the ancient Egyptians built for their people. ",Counterclaim
"Also, some people think that aliens do exist on mars, and that NASA is just hiding it. ",Counterclaim
Since not everyone was satisfied ,Counterclaim
"Many people may think that the aliens created it to show their is life on mars.
",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, some may also say that they is no proof. The Face could just as well be life on another planet",Counterclaim
"However, people believed it was too cludy to see clearly.",Counterclaim
"However putting myself in the shoes of a person who wouldn't know about all these facts or opinions, I could see why these beliefs are taken seriously.",Counterclaim
Although the face was thought to be alien ,Counterclaim
Though some theorists still believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens,Counterclaim
I can see why some people don't see why it could be a landform And that its actually something else it does look like a face .it could actually be a statue and not just land shaped in to something but the thing is of it was really a statue or remaines of something or someone ,Counterclaim
"
Conspiracy theorists think that it is bona fide evidence that there is life on Mars",Counterclaim
Some people were not happy. ,Counterclaim
They had said that the camera the pictures had been taken with had to peer through clouds to see the Face. They believed that the alien markings were hidden by the haze at the time. ,Counterclaim
"Skeptics say, ""Perhaps alien markings were hidden by the haze.""",Counterclaim
He began to say that ailens put it there! ,Counterclaim
"Many skeptics believe that this ""face"" is proof of life forms on Mars and that NASA is just trying to cover it up. ",Counterclaim
"While many conspiracy theorists would still like to believe that aliens created this face on the moon,",Counterclaim
Those who believe in aliens building the face on Mars might srgue that NASA is secretly holding evidence that there theories are correct.,Counterclaim
but there is always both sides to a situation like this.,Counterclaim
 Because of the landform on Mars people thought that is was solide evience that life was on mars or that there was life on Mars.,Counterclaim
yet it still resembled a face so conspiarators still beleived that there was still life on mars or that there was life on Mars. The people that weren't saticfied said that The Face on Mars is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April of 1998 which is a cloudy time on Mars,Counterclaim
Not everyone was satified with the picture ,Counterclaim
Conspiracy theorist still do not believe Nasa so they demand more photos,Counterclaim
Theorist say that everything Nasa does is either faked or fixed to look like something it is not. In this case it went viral and many people still believe it was aliens that went there and did that,Counterclaim
Some believe that it is real evidence that there is life on Mars ,Counterclaim
"Some skeptics said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by the clouds,",Counterclaim
"Yes, you may be right in some way.

Yes, we have found traces of aliens over the years.

This COULD have been made by aliens.

Maybe they are trying to connect to other life outside of their planet.

That is the only argument that you have against me. ",Counterclaim
"A final example is, how the skeptics thought it was created. ""If the aliens didn't create it then how did it form?"" That question was most likely going through their mind, trying to figure out if they should believe science and research or they should believe movies and others.",Counterclaim
" Granted, the rumors of clouds blocking the actual image of the face was a logical argument.",Counterclaim
In 1976 Viking 1 took a photo of formations on mars. The picture looked like a face so the people of the world thought oh my god. Aliens invaded mars and they will invade us run ,Counterclaim
But two decades later (give or take two years) another picture was taken and to more and more people thought it was a face.,Counterclaim
I would understand why somone would belive it was not a natural landform. one reson they may not is in the text it stats it was winter in april 98 it was clooudy time of year on the red planit. In the text it also stats that some pepoul belived aliens marking where hidden by haze. ,Counterclaim
"So by thinking hardly about this it comes to mind could people that dont believe, could possibly being saying that this mesa isnt a mesa but something NASA is trying to cover up?",Counterclaim
So some people believe that the face is actually just a natural landform but some people such as conspiracy theorists dont. I say that the conspiracy theorists have a point on why Nasa could be lying to the public. ,Counterclaim
These things started all the talk about the face being created by aliens. ,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, it's easy to see why people would think that the face was created by aliens ",Counterclaim
Some people thought that Nasa was hiding evidence that there is life on Mars ,Counterclaim
 I know not all people believe us that it isn't an alien monument. ,Counterclaim
Conspiracy theorists say that scientist want to hide evidence that there is life on Mars. Other people say it was an ancient civilization on Mars.,Counterclaim
"Most people believed this, but not everyone. they figured the coordinents 41 degrees north martian latitude. In April of 1998 it was winter at the time, which is the time of year Mars becomes cloudy. This means the camera on board had to look through wispy clouds, which could hide some of the evidence ",Counterclaim
"Even though NASA has put the picture out there that proves that the face on Mars is not acually a face but just another land formation, there are still some skeptics out there that think taht the theory is true.",Counterclaim
For the beliefs that the fog that appeared in another photo was due to alien activity,Counterclaim
"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Marsevidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists",Counterclaim
"While it may be true, the essay does not say anything about anyone actually getting on Mars to see if it was really just a rock.",Counterclaim
Others are saing that NASA knows that the face was obviously made by aliens but they just don't want to tell us.,Counterclaim
"Others say, that aliens made this formation.",Counterclaim
Allthough many people still believe that scientists must have missed something and that it really is a allien artifact,Counterclaim
Some people would say that NASA is hiding stuff. ,Counterclaim
Many conspiracy theorists thought that this could actually be evidence of life on Mars,Counterclaim
There is a small chance that the picture we saw that appears to be a face was left by ailens.,Counterclaim
"Now some might say that our picture we claim that is extremly crediable could be nomore than a fluke, and there could be aliens and a chance for a new civilization on Mars ",Counterclaim
However the scientist doesn't think that. ,Counterclaim
"people, mostly conspiracy theorists, started thinking ""What if aliens formed it?"" Some scientist even started to believe that it was an alien artificat.",Counterclaim
Some people say it was created by aliens ,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, conspiracy theorists and skeptics argue that the picture isn't clear enough for someone to make out any markings on the landform. ",Counterclaim
" People still weren't satisfied and pressed on though, arguing that the picture was taken on a cloudy day and the haze in the photo blocked out any special markings or evidence.",Counterclaim
"Some consipiracy theorists say that the form was actually created by aliens,",Counterclaim
Now I under stand that it does look like a human face yes. And different people have went up there just to take picturse of it.,Counterclaim
"In April of 1998, a photo was taken that was blury due to Martian clouds. Many people exclaimed that the clouds may have blocked some alien markings.",Counterclaim
"Others may say that, comparative to the Mound Builder Indians on Earth, the ""Face"" was created by Martians bringing dirt to one spot and creating that ""mound"". ",Counterclaim
Some people thought it led to maybe living things being there. It then became an acient civlazation on mars. ,Counterclaim
They wanted to belive that it was real. ,Counterclaim
Some people did not want to belive that it was not real. They wanted to keep trying. They then wanted to take a second look. The poeple wanted to make sure that we did not miss anything. ,Counterclaim
"Even though most people believe that it is a natural landform, some do believe it was aliens who created it. ",Counterclaim
"The majority of people accepted this statement, but there was a select few people who say that aliens made the Face. ",Counterclaim
Some can argue an say it could be lots of other things such as sign of life on mars or being made by aliens ,Counterclaim
"Though some people, like cospiracy theorists, may say that NASA wants to hide a type of evidence for life on Mars,",Counterclaim
"In the article it states""Some people think the Face is Bona Fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" People think there is life on Mars. They dont believe that the face is a natural land form. Many people I bet still wonder how it got there ",Counterclaim
For people to say that aliens are the ones causing it to look like a Face is also a arguement.,Counterclaim
"Mant people doubt the fact that it is alien, why? because you usually do not see aliens in sight, unless you are watching a movie or reading a book about them. ",Counterclaim
"The photographs that were first taken of the ""Face"" were very hazy, and many people believed that there were some sort of alien markings under all the fog. ",Counterclaim
"Well, I suppose it coud have been made by aliens",Counterclaim
There are also people who think aliens created it. They think this because it really isn't an everyday think to see a landform that resembles a face.,Counterclaim
People who believed aliens created it were unsatisfied because the way Mars faced in 98' it was winter time. So it was very cloudy.,Counterclaim
Others say that it looks like something made by somehing esle other than humans or nature. And they say it has the look of being man made. ,Counterclaim
"For people who think aliens did this, say that our camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds which we couldn't see much, think the aliens were probably hiding",Counterclaim
"For those who feel that the Face was created by aliens,",Counterclaim
Those who belive a alien created the face possibly would say that NASA would keep aliens a secret because it would frighten some people. They also could ask the question how and why did the rock or land for the way it did if its just a land form?,Counterclaim
The alien belivers can also say that the aliens hide when humans come to Mars,Counterclaim
Now NASA could be wrong the pictures could have been edited to contain the secret that there was life on mars. NASA could have tampered with the photographs to mislead the public.,Counterclaim
Some people around the world think things like this would be great to brag about ,Counterclaim
"However, just because this face-like rock is from aliens doesn't mean that the theory of aliens isn't true. ",Counterclaim
It convinced some it was natural and some still believed that it was made by aliens.,Counterclaim
NASA is apart of the Government. The Government lies all the time.,Counterclaim
"On the contrary, some people believe that the face is """"Bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars--evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists"" (p. 5).",Counterclaim
"Speaking of conspiracy theories, many believed that ""...the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars"".",Counterclaim
We knew as soon as the pictures where released that the critics and media would go go crazy on Nasa. Of course we know that theres people that are going to think Nasa is hiding information from the public,Counterclaim
"Many scientists have seen this face as life on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists have said there is life on Mars,and NASA is trying to hide it from the people.",Counterclaim
"Although, the second time NASA took the pictures it was cloudy, so they could be trying to hide something. ",Counterclaim
"Some say that NASA is keeping this monumental secret from us,",Counterclaim
Skeptics of the Face might say that it is all a well thought out trick to hide alien life ffrom the general public.,Counterclaim
Some migfht that you can't actually tell what things really are just from a picture because it is only a proportion ,Counterclaim
Some might say that you can tell by the picture thaat Viking 1 spacecraft took because of the type of technology they were using in the 20th century.,Counterclaim
Conspiracy theorists began saying that NASA was holding out on them by not saying the complete truth about their discovery,Counterclaim
"Zeke, who was a man of what he said, did not believe me and wouldn't take my word for it.",Counterclaim
There is a preconcieved notion that NASA is hiding the discovery that the face is alien made ,Counterclaim
"Finally,

why people say that the landfrom was formed by aliens is because it

"" appered in books, magazines and radio talk shows--- even haunted grocery store for 25 years"".",Counterclaim
Althought not everybody beleives that the face is a natural occuring phenomon they believe that is evidence of a ancient Martian civilization. ,Counterclaim
"But there are still people that believe it is a ancient Matian civilization,",Counterclaim
"Some people who still believe that the Face was created by aliens say that ""alien markings were hidden by haze"", but the Face was only hidden because it was winter when the photo was taken.",Counterclaim
Unfortunately many therorist now say that the face was undeniable proof of alien life! ,Counterclaim
Even so the public still believed in what they thought rather than what they saw. ,Counterclaim
 Some people are against nasa and sa that it is aliens.,Counterclaim
"Certain people still say that ""it's aliens, aliens are making these faces!""",Counterclaim
"Many conspiracy therorists are saying that it was constructed by aliens,",Counterclaim
Not everyone was satisfied with the outcome. Some skepticcs said that alien marking were hiden by the haze. ,Counterclaim
"In the article, some people think that the Alien markings were hidden by haze.",Counterclaim
Others might say that think it's all fake,Counterclaim
" Since the image was uploaded not everyone was satisfied. Skeptics, still beleve that alien was hiddenby haze.",Counterclaim
"The conspiracy theorists and many people in general probably think that NASA is hiding the fact that aliens are real, so they're lying about the Face and just saying that it's a landform, when they think it's a sign that aliens exist.",Counterclaim
"The man asked how does NASA know that this rock formation that you ""supposedly"" think, is a mesa? He just thinks that it's a sign of aliens. ",Counterclaim
"Believers in this ""face"" may claim there was never a clear picture of the ""face"" taken after the first photo. ",Counterclaim
"People say it is not a a natural landform , they think it was from alien matter ",Counterclaim
So skeptis said that perhaps the the alien markings were hidden by the haze.,Counterclaim
Conspriacy theorists say it actually was aliens and they made the face,Counterclaim
There are a lot of people that think it has to be a face.,Counterclaim
"Some people are not satisfied with the results. They say,""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze",Counterclaim
"I know for a fact that this is a monument made by aliens because no astronaut has gone to mars yet. Who would of made this if no one was there, I know that there is no way for you to prove to me that this was not made by aliens.""",Counterclaim
There is the arguement that the Face is evidence of an ancient civilization ,Counterclaim
"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. ",Counterclaim
"Some may still be skeptical,",Counterclaim
"Some skeptics may still doubt that the Face wasn't created by aliens, believing that NASA is just attempting to hide the evidence of an ancient civilization ",Counterclaim
We had non believers at NASA like myself,Counterclaim
People were not satisfied and said it was a haze,Counterclaim
"Lastly, lets all say that the so called face really was an ancient alien structure, why would NASA keep it a secret.",Counterclaim
"But skeptics again were skeptic as always, and said that since it was taken during the winter, which is a cloudy time on Mars, that the alien markings of the Face were hidden by haze. ",Counterclaim
"Some people even think that it is possible that there is somehow life there on Mars.
",Counterclaim
You may say that aliens made something like this ,Counterclaim
"My next point is that many people say that N.A.S.A

is just keeping secrets of aliens away from the public.",Counterclaim
"In paragraph five it states,""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars and evidence that NASA would rather hide,say conspiracy theorists"".",Counterclaim
"In the passage it says,""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hid, say conspiracy theorists.",Counterclaim
Now some skeptics might say that NASA might be unreliable and might have changed the photo,Counterclaim
"Though it was said to be only a landscape on Cydonia, the news of the face went crazy. It starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines, and so on. Others thought that NASA would rather hide the true information of the face and just say it was the shadows which made us think it was a face. ",Counterclaim
Some hardcore conspiracy theorists might say NASA was trying to pull a wool over our eyes and cover up the existents of extraterestrial life with fake pictures.,Counterclaim
"Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists ",Counterclaim
"But even after these new pictures conspiracy theorist were still bent on the idea that NASA was trying to cover something up. In spite of the new pictures people said that the day the photo was taken, it was cloudy. Therefor the photos couldn't be very accurate",Counterclaim
Some scientists are not sure of the Face. They think it is created by aliens. They might be right since it is theory and answer is not given.,Counterclaim
"I know that some people think that maybe aliens are the ones who made the face, and you may be right. ",Counterclaim
"Some people argue that, due to the cloudiness on the planet, alien life could have been hidden by haze. ",Counterclaim
"Other people might say that in the photo of '98, taken by the cmaera on board the MGS had to pear through wispy clouds to see the face, which made the alien markings hidden by the haze.",Counterclaim
"Not everyone had agreed with what they had said, which cause a comotion. Other people had said they were clearly oblivious to the alien markings hidden by the haze.",Counterclaim
"People claimed that because it was a cloudy day when the picture was taken, the alien markings were hidden by haze ",Counterclaim
 they just asume that the landformation thats sticking out of the ground is alian because it has basic facial featers,Counterclaim
"but not everyone was satisfied with the real answer . People think that NASA is trying to hide the real evidence . The text states "" Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide , say conspiracy theorists.""",Counterclaim
"The theorists claim that NASA is hiding the ""true"" way it was made so they don't frighten citizens ",Counterclaim
Just looking at the picture below paragraph five makes me want to believe that the face is really a face rather than a natural landform,Counterclaim
"The idea that the face is bona fide evidence on Mars makes sense, maybe the people on Mars were giants with two miles wide faces?",Counterclaim
"I can see why most people had thought it was a acient alien artifact though. I mean most people dedicate their life finding out if there is more lifeforms out there. So most people had to have hope. For the sake of what they chose to do with there life.
",Counterclaim
Others (on th other hand) were devistated (for the same reason in paragraph 3),Counterclaim
While people still release theories hoping for more evidence of alien life ,Counterclaim
"The Face looks like it was created by aliens but why does every landform on Earth looks like it is created by aliens.¨the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Perhaps, aliens marking were hidden by haze¨( Skeptics,article 8 ). Yes, it may has",Counterclaim
If aliens did make this,Counterclaim
But some people believe other things on how this rock some how looks like a face,Counterclaim
" But there were people who still believed that aliens did this and that the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.",Counterclaim
"For instance, now people are starting to prove that aliens are real because of a big face-shaped mountain on Mars.",Counterclaim
"Yes, maybe if we were ON Mars we would find some new facts to maybe prove one anothers views even more ",Counterclaim
People claim that NASA is hiding the evidence revealing that the Face is actually made by aliens.,Counterclaim
People who claim that the Face was created by aliens will state that the photograph taken in April of 1998 was not enough proof of the Face being a natural landform,Counterclaim
"Some people think aliens created the ""face"" on mars. ",Counterclaim
"Many people make ridiculous assuotions, like how they think aliens created this face on mars, even though there can be human life on mars but those are just theorys people are making. Which is when everyone starts amking these assuptions and even make it look belivable that aliens could have possible made the ""face on mars"".",Counterclaim
There a many reasons that make it seem like the land form could have been made by aliens ,Counterclaim
Some people think that the photograph of the humans face found on Mars was created by alien life. Most people believe the rocks photograph of an humans face is real because they believe NASA is hiding alien life from the public meanwhile,Counterclaim
Others say that the Face was made by aliens. They say that the photos weren't clear enough and that NASA is trying to hide the ancient alien civiliazation ,Counterclaim
" Even though people were given that information that the shadowy figure was indeed not an alien monument, some people were still not satisfied. So mission controllers decided to look again. ",Counterclaim
Of course not everyone was happy. It's much cooler to have it be a alien artifact than a natural landform. People weren't giving up. The face is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter of April 98' when the camera on bored of MGS had to peer through clouds to see the face. Skeptics said the alein markings were hidden by haze. ,Counterclaim
Many people still doubted that it was a mesa after this photo due to wispy clouds bluring the picture of the monument.,Counterclaim
"People argue that the mesa in Ohio doesn't have a face appearing on the top,",Counterclaim
"Most people though that was made for aliens, but it wasn't.",Counterclaim
Some people think that the mesa was actually created by aliens.,Counterclaim
That day was cloudy however so any type of alien finding could have been hidden in the haze. ,Counterclaim
The conspiracy theroies piled up as some stated that the pictures were perfect evidence of life on Mars. ,Counterclaim
I was thrillled when I read this becuase it proved my hypothesis correct. But there were still some people who werent satisfied by the images. Some people claimed that there was a haze that kept the alien markings hidden. ,Counterclaim
They thought is was made by aliens because they usually don't see this face,Counterclaim
It is understandable that people thought it was an alien head,Counterclaim
A few scientists believe that it is an alien artifact.,Counterclaim
"Not everyone agreed with the picture that was tooken. Because the photo was tooken in April'98, which was a cloudy time of year for Mars, people suggested alien markings were hidden by haze ",Counterclaim
"On the other hand maybe its not a natural landform maybe some people may be right it could be some type of alien landform.

NASA could have done somthing to the pictures to mess with the hopefulls. In paragraph (8) states that "" The camera on board the MGS had to peer through the whispy coulds to see that face. Perhaps, siad skeptics , alien markings were hidden by haze.",Counterclaim
Researcher still wanna way to find out how to make it where people can live on any of the planets. ,Counterclaim
"Even with the most updated and accurate picture from 2001, people still like to argue it could be a connection to alien life ",Counterclaim
"Maybe but some people does, there might be an alien,",Counterclaim
Skeptics may believe that the face could be more proof that aliens exist in outer space,Counterclaim
"There have been many conspiracies about the Face, some more convincing than others. Some are about alien lifeforms creating the Face and that some are still living on Mars ",Counterclaim
"When NASA unvieled the photos of the ""face"" on Mars critics believed that this was proof of life on Mars and that NASA would want to hide this information.
",Counterclaim
After these pictures were relased people still weren't satisfied and said that alien markings could've been hidden by the wispy clouds ,Counterclaim
While the public and other scientists thought this face was bona fide evidence on mars ,Counterclaim
"But apperently after taking all this time, not everyone was satsified. The people still belive that, it is alien monument.",Counterclaim
""" Well i guess you have a point there, but that doesn't change the fact that i believe in aliens. ",Counterclaim
People began to say that the aliens were hidden by a haze since the camera it was taken with had to zoom through the clouds in order to take the shot.,Counterclaim
On the flip side people and scientis have belived and wondered if aliens are real,Counterclaim
Although some people might say this is not a natural land form. They might say that it is a alien artifact left by some martians,Counterclaim
"However, some people were not satisfied with this discovery. Conspiracy theorists began to theorize that there were alien markings hidden by haze, ",Counterclaim
"Conspiract theorists also believe that NASA is hiding evidence from the general public, ",Counterclaim
"Now a lot of people think that NASA is keeping information from them, and that there is life on mars.
",Counterclaim
The natural landforms that mars is making peope think that its made by aliens,Counterclaim
"So, when the Face hit Hollywood people went wild and decided that it must be aliens. ",Counterclaim
"""Ok Sam they could have just made that up, the authors said, ""reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars"". ",Counterclaim
Perhaps people wanted to think the face on Mars was created by aliens just so it couold be a good story for a magazine or Hollywood film,Counterclaim
"Yet, theorists are unconvinced. ",Counterclaim
People were still not satisfied with our information at this point.,Counterclaim
Maybe mars was like Earth at one point in time and there was extra terrestrial life on Mars but something made them leave and made Mars just a floating sandy rock in space. ,Counterclaim
"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. ",Counterclaim
"We have many questions asking things like, "" How do you know that aliens didn't form it?""

and, ""How do we know that this picture is not photoshopped to get NASA more commercial business?""",Counterclaim
"People send NASA emails, and letters asking questions. One of our most states opinions is,"" Just because it looks like a landform on Earth doesn't mean anything. Things might be different there and there could be aliens there.""",Counterclaim
" Then people started saying statements like,"" Perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze.""",Counterclaim
 But skeptics say that the aliens images were hidden by the haze.,Counterclaim
"People were sad to see that it was not a alien moument after all, but some people still thought that it was still an alien moument.

They thought that because it was cloudy on the red planet the alien markings were hidden by haze. ",Counterclaim
"Some people were not convinced that the face was a natural landform , due to there being haze, winds and also a cloudy time to see the face through the camera, there were conspriacy theorists that said ""Perhaps skeptic and alien markings were hidden by the haze."" ",Counterclaim
I know most people will stick to thier belief that aliens are real and that they created the Face,Counterclaim
I know I may make some people upset by stating the facts,Counterclaim
"I do not blame those of you that believe it was created by aliens,it sounds cool right?",Counterclaim
Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide.,Counterclaim
"They also thought that since NASA was sending so many aircrafts to get a picture of it, they were just trying to cover up the truth.",Counterclaim
"Sure, the landform looks somewhat like a face in the 1976 picture",Counterclaim
" You are of course entitled to your own opinion,",Counterclaim
"Although, I can see why people would think it was created by aliens ",Counterclaim
Some people say that NASA and scientists are trying to keep the aliens a secret and keep them from us ,Counterclaim
"NASA released the photos originally to drum uo buzz aroung their programs. It worked most definitely, but the attention created sceptices.",Counterclaim
"The face was initially discovered May 24, 2001 and ever since conspiracy theorists have run wild with the idea that it was made by aliens.",Counterclaim
Some people might say that aliens mightve moved the rocks there themselves.,Counterclaim
Yes it may look a alien or something out in space made it,Counterclaim
Yes I do see why you or some people would get that it looks out of this world,Counterclaim
"Reaserchers say this could be an alien, ",Counterclaim
People think that it looks like a face and I cant not argue with that ,Counterclaim
Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.,Counterclaim
People starting believing that it was evidence of life on Mars ,Counterclaim
 Even after having all this evidence people sill didn't believe that it's not an alien because they said the pitcure was cloudy and could've been hidden ,Counterclaim
"Though there may be some instance of some alien life form out there, such as the Wow Signal",Counterclaim
"Again skepics were not satisfied, the picture was taken on a cloudy day over Mars. So they began to ask questions like; What if the alein markings were hidden by haze? ",Counterclaim
Well what if NASA is hiding evidence of ancient alein life on Mars?,Counterclaim
Thats when they got some people who were mad that it wasn't an alien artifact. Perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze.,Counterclaim
"Conspiracy theorists may say that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars , and that NASA would rather hide this evidence (paragraph 5). ",Counterclaim
"Yes, I understand it's' a planet we haven't been on yet",Counterclaim
"I see your point of view though, I get that MOC could have gotten the picture wrong",Counterclaim
"Yes, it was cloudy to and that could have caused some major differnces comapred to when it is sunny. The ""alien markings could have been hidden by haze"" ",Counterclaim
"The picture could have been photoshopped to make it look different,",Counterclaim
Now you might say that the face found on Mars is accually an alien monument. ,Counterclaim
But still people say that NASA warped this picture and that NASA wants us to no proof of alien life forms.,Counterclaim
"There is also a people group who would say that because there was a haze in that region of Mars the day that the 2001 picture was taken, that the picture did not capture the whole thing or the complete Face in all that it is.",Counterclaim
Many of you think that there are alien markings hidden by haze.,Counterclaim
Many conspiracy theorists believe that NASA is hiding life on Mars from the rest of the world. ,Counterclaim
 but people still belive it's an anchent martion civalization. The picture that was taken in 1998 was taken on a foggy day on mars so people still think it could be a profe to life on mars ,Counterclaim
"I would unerstand why people would think it was created by these myth cretures, ",Counterclaim
People still thought thet they were made by aliens many other people disagreed on it,Counterclaim
" conspiacy theorists said it might be an evidence that life exists on Mars, and saying NASA is hiding it",Counterclaim
"I know what you might be thinking. How could it only be a natural landform? It looks exactly like a face, so it must have been created by something or someone. ",Counterclaim
"some people still weren't convinced. They said that the picture was taken on a cloudy winter day, so many skeptics thought that maybe there were alien markings that were just hidden by haze. ",Counterclaim
"However In the passage it states ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-Evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" Which I could see why some people would believe that NASA would want to hide amazing information like that. They could think that the people of Earth are not ready to quite that out yet. ",Counterclaim
"But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees norht martian latitude where it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year on the red planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.
",Counterclaim
"Moving forward, people think NASA is hiding something ",Counterclaim
"Of course there might be life on Mars, but there's no way to know for sure. ",Counterclaim
" Some people might say that NASA is trying to hide the fact that there is alien life on Mars,",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, some people say that NASA is hiding the fact that there is alien life on Mar's.",Counterclaim
"Another reason that bothers me is how people think its a conspiracy theory. many, many, many people think ""oh its just nothing but the martians""",Counterclaim
People may argue by saying so if it is something simular to earth then that means martians were here to and then they got bord of the place they so they left and went somewhere else. then they built this big face of maybe a king or emporer or something and they are hiding from us ,Counterclaim
"Skeptics were far from convinced by the 1998 photos, many of them claimed that NASA had chosen to take the picture during a cloudy period of Mars' year to cover up an ancient alien artifact, or possible markings. ",Counterclaim
"However, those who say it is created by aliens disaprove with the fact that the ""face"" is just natural landforms.",Counterclaim
They took another picture and people still didn't believe them,Counterclaim
You may say that that probe is floating very far away from space how do you know there is not any evidence of life down there? ,Counterclaim
"Others say that the Face is an alien artifact. They say that us at NASA are covering up the fact that there is life on Mars. Another thing they say is that on April 5, 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor took pictures of the Face the alien markings were hidden by the haze due to it being winter on Mars at the time. ",Counterclaim
"Now I know what some of you are thinking, ""What if NASA is hiding something.",Counterclaim
"Even though with the low resoution, it looks like an Egyptian pharaoh",Counterclaim
"but it sure is possible that those pictures could've been covered up and are designed to look like natural land forms, as the conspiracy theorists are claiming because how could you possibly know what they did to the photos before releasing them to the public?",Counterclaim
but again how can you take that for literal truth? ,Counterclaim
"Though not everyone was satasfied with the results.

When they took that photo, The Faces on Mars was located at 41 degress north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98. This is a cloudy time of a year on the Red Planet. ",Counterclaim
"Conspericy theorists want to say that we, NASA, know that it is from aliens and that we're just trying to keep it a secret.",Counterclaim
Some people might believe that it is a human face,Counterclaim
Although some people have very convensing stories as to how that land form got there,Counterclaim
If they do exist I would have no problem with that ,Counterclaim
Others think its a icon for something a alien made because its shaped as a face a few scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. Some people think the face is nonafide evidence of real life on Mars. ,Counterclaim
"So even if you thought we were lying saying ""Oh this image is a lie they have secret ones that actually show that there's life on Mars in their building, ",Counterclaim
"However, their is a possibility that there are aliens on mars.",Counterclaim
Many people will say that the face on Mars was created by previous creatures living there ,Counterclaim
"Although there are many, many facts about the face on Mars, I would get if you came up to me and said ""Aliens did this to Mras because its so detail and how could that be if no one has been to Mars, so there are aliens. ",Counterclaim
"Although, the natural landform does look like an alien,",Counterclaim
"Some may say that the ""Face"" is a clear example to show the life on Mars, and that these creatures created this landform as a sign or as an art.",Counterclaim
" Many conspiracy theorists state that NASA is hiding the truth from us. They believe that the Face on Mars is key evidence for life on Mars,",Counterclaim
"Many believe that maybe it was just a bad picture and thatthere could be hidden alien markings,",Counterclaim
Well not everyone was happy about it not being an alien ,Counterclaim
"Conspiracy theorist believe there was alliens involded in the makeing of the ""Face on Mars"" ",Counterclaim
I do believe that at first you would probably think that an alien created this,Counterclaim
They just want to say conspiracy theorists and not tell the truth,Counterclaim
I think that this face is made by alien lifeform because it really looks a face.,Counterclaim
You might say that we NASA are trying to keep things secret from all of you in the publice and that we just want to keep the discovery of aliens to our selfs ,Counterclaim
So some people said the alien face was hidden by haze.,Counterclaim
Some even said it looks like something here on earth. Either a pyramid in Egyptian time or maybe even a mountain.,Counterclaim
"Even though we think it is natural landform you guys think that aliens have made it and your point is as it says in the article ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze."" ",Counterclaim
People think it is a face that aliens put on there. ,Counterclaim
"People may think it is formed by aliens because, how else would it get there? Or, why would it just randomly look like that? ",Counterclaim
"In contrast, conspiracy theorists say that there is a face on Mars and that there is ancient civilization on Mars. ",Counterclaim
Some people think the face on Mars is an alien artifact.,Counterclaim
But poeple didnt believe that it actually was a land form because it was very cloudy near the planet mars.,Counterclaim
 On the other hand you might think they are real and i don't blame you because when i was little i thought they was real to ... by all of the movies i was watching about aliens taking over ect ,Counterclaim
"Although , few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact photographing .",Counterclaim
Most people argue saying that this could be a sign that there use to be life on Mars. ,Counterclaim
Many people were unsatisfied. They claimed that since the picture of the Face was taken in a cloudy area it might explain why no one saw life in the first place.,Counterclaim
"It might have been cool that the ""Face on Mars"" was really real. There are times that we think it was a face but it wasn't took at the right angle to see the face.",Counterclaim
"That's not all,one paragraph eight,it states""but not everyone was satisfied",Counterclaim
Some believed alien markings were hidden by the haze ,Counterclaim
"Some conspiracy theorists aruge that even though the picture was not at high resolution, you can still see a face. ",Counterclaim
"My friend Fred thinks that aliens did it, aliens arent real... are they? ",Counterclaim
 Conspracy theorist belived that the illusion explanation was just a cover up.,Counterclaim
Yet with all the proof some people did not believe that it wasnt just a regular Mars mesa due to that it was a cloudy year on Mars ,Counterclaim
Some people believe that the face that has been photographed on Mars is evidence of alien life;,Counterclaim
"Now, some people may say, ""But wait! That face is clear evidence of alien life, and there is no way that a face like that could have naturally formed on Mars!""",Counterclaim
The people who think it is a alien or a alien artifact think that NASA would hide this from the public,Counterclaim
"On the otherhand, some people think that NASA would rather hide the fact that it could be life on Mars, say conspiracy theorists. ",Counterclaim
"Some say that the face has been created by aliens and that it is not a natural landform. The article states that, ""But not everyone was satisfied.",Counterclaim
"Opposers say that this information is bona fide evidence. ""Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. ",Counterclaim
"While I don't agree with them, I do see their side. The general public has all reasons to be suspicious torwards the ""Face of Mars!"" Sounds like something from ""The Twilight Zone. ",Counterclaim
perhaps skeptis say alien markings were hidden by the haze.,Counterclaim
"By looking at the images from 1976 and 1998 I can see where someone might mistake it for a humaniod face. The images are a little blurry and because of this you can see what appears to be eyes, a nose and a mouth. ",Counterclaim
There have been many claims of extraterestrial life forms on Mars. ,Counterclaim
Maybe there was once aliens ,Counterclaim
"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Marsevidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.",Counterclaim
"Some people didn't agree because ""it was winter in April '98--a cloudy time of the year",Counterclaim
"The text states, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien amrkings were hidden by haze."" This evidence shows how people continue to believe that the Face could've have alien marking all around it, but they couldn't have been spotted because it was winter on the Red Planet so it was very cloudy to spot anything like that. ",Counterclaim
The Face of Mars could have been made by alien because of the unexplainable things on Earth itself.,Counterclaim
"First off, this argument is over whether Face was created by aliens, or whether it is just a natural landform.",Counterclaim
"That should be the end of the discussion, but yet you say, ""But Mister science man, what if the pictures that you took couldn't see it because it was too small?""",Counterclaim
"Don't think I don't see you thinking, ""But will a only a photo actually be able to properly discern whether this is natural.""",Counterclaim
However the phot was taken during a cloudy time of the year on Mars. ,Counterclaim
People still want to believe that there is life out in space ,Counterclaim
Many people are trying to say that the face was created by aliens ,Counterclaim
" Many think that NASA is trying to hide evidence that there IS lifeforms on other planets,",Counterclaim
Has the face on mars been put there by alien? Well statments say that aliens have came and put this face on mars. ,Counterclaim
"Some people think the Face is evience of life on Mars. Theorists say NASA was trying to hide the evidece,",Counterclaim
"But many argued otherwise.
",Counterclaim
"In the passage it says "" It looks like something that aliens made"". Like I said some people think its from aliens",Counterclaim
 But some pictures of the Face on Mars actually looks like a face,Counterclaim
"He argued and argued over how the aliens built it,and how its just been hidden all these years.",Counterclaim
He still thought the marsians made the formation of the face.,Counterclaim
Mason still didn't agree that the form on Mars was a natural landform.,Counterclaim
"Even though images proved that the Face was a natural landform and not something created by aliens, there still remained people who didn't believe this concept ",Counterclaim
"
However there is a reason why some people may believ that this is an alien making. The cameras that were used that day had trouble getting a clear image because of the cloudy weather that day. So the image is very blurred which may lead to some differnt reasoning on the ""Face on Mars"" ",Counterclaim
"Still some people didn't belive that

NASA was hiding something.",Counterclaim
Some critics support theories that NASA is hiding the knowledge of life on Mars.,Counterclaim
Some people might argue that you cannot see the face clearly since it s usually very cloudy over that region.,Counterclaim
Some scientist say that on the planet Mars that there was a face created by aliens,Counterclaim
Conspiracy theorists say that the people of NASA are hiding the evidence of life on Mars.,Counterclaim
"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" (paragraph 5).",Counterclaim
"Some people, however, were not convinced. ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by a haze."" People believed the clouds had blocked the view of ""alien markings"".",Counterclaim
Many conspiracy theorists say that this is something thaat nasa should not have put out for all to see. they say that in the picture that was sent out was too foggy and that it was hiding things in the fog. ,Counterclaim
"Sure, there can possibly be aliens in the universe somewhere, there probably is!",Counterclaim
You could argue and say aliens made it.,Counterclaim
"It's a great way to assume how it happened by comparing Mars to Earth, but it could also be irrelevent.",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, we were not there with those people to know that it wasn't true.",Counterclaim
"The logical conclusion for the illogical is ""What if they are underground?"" and this is a valid point until you look at it more closely.",Counterclaim
"Some might argue, ""Well, NASA is just covering up life on Mars.""",Counterclaim
"I can see why many people would think the natural formation looked much like an alien because, as included in the exerpt, it looked like a shadowy likeness of a human face.",Counterclaim
If you think that NASA wants to hide this for their research ,Counterclaim
"People think that aliens had put a Haze over the face so the peoploe couldnt see it anymore. ""The camera on board MGs had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. perhaps, said skeptics, Alien markings were hidden by haze.(8) ",Counterclaim
he said the picture look like alien heads.,Counterclaim
But if there was aliens On mare why would they just make one landform that looks like a face if there was aliens on mars im sure they wouldnt just make one that looks like a face and dont make anymore. They would make more and more till they got tired of making them ,Counterclaim
Some thimk that this is pure evidence of life on Mars ,Counterclaim
Scientists can be wrong sometimes though.,Counterclaim
Though some people think otherwise. ,Counterclaim
Though other scientist belived alien markings were being hidden by wispy clouds.,Counterclaim
Still people think that the alien markings are still there. ,Counterclaim
People from around the world believed NASA wanted to hide something. That they didn't want anyone knowing there really was life on Mars.,Counterclaim
"The people argued that, because it was winter on Mars, it was to cloudy for the camera to take a proper photograph. They thought maybe alien markings were covered by haze.",Counterclaim
aliens probably wanted it to be like that,Counterclaim
Some may not believe that this is a natural landform.,Counterclaim
Some apponents may say that the Face on Mars was made by aliens. Maybe they have a point.,Counterclaim
"Then, even though the concluding statement was that it was only a rock landform, many people argue that it was an usual formation created by aliens. Scientists and other people believe it was an alien aritifact.",Counterclaim
Others may say that NASA has more information than what they are telling us.,Counterclaim
But there some students that disagree with us because community service takes too much time away from what they need. ,Counterclaim
The students would probably not like to do something like that again. Also the staff would be less ecstatic about trips these are some down sides. ,Counterclaim
I understand why some kids would not want to do community service because they may want to have fun doing other things with their friends or have a busy life.,Counterclaim
The work you do during community service may not be too fun ,Counterclaim
Some people may think it takes out to much time,Counterclaim
But in some cases it would be a good thing because it would keep our planet cleaner and there wouldn't be as much pollution then there is now. ,Counterclaim
Also it would help if we clean up the earth because the rate a global warming would be decreasing.,Counterclaim
Most teens my age are very self-centered. They go to the mall and think that community work is just done for the,Counterclaim
Sure cleaning doesn't sound like a great idea ,Counterclaim
"While picking up trash on the side of the road may not be someone's idea of serving their community,",Counterclaim
"While some people may think that community service is a waste of time, ",Counterclaim
"Other students might not like this idea,",Counterclaim
"I am not saying that community service is bad. Actually, I think that I should do it more often.",Counterclaim
But there can be a compromise to help with this situation. We can start a club for students after school where they can go do any kind of community service ,Counterclaim
Though some of the community services we may do could be very dangerous. ,Counterclaim
I'm sure there has to be some people who actually want to,Counterclaim
There are some up sides to that idea and i understand that it would help the environment and make the neighborhood look a lot better. ,Counterclaim
Some students think community service is a waste of time and effort.,Counterclaim
Yeah you might think that its for their best interest and it would look good on our college resseme and all ,Counterclaim
Even though some students in the school think it would be a terrible idea,Counterclaim
"even if some kids don't want to do it because its ""stupid"" or ""a waste of my time""",Counterclaim
that is why some of my friends and students don't agree with me about doing community service. ,Counterclaim
People shouldn't think that doing community service wastes your time,Counterclaim
in all school kids are always think the doing community service is just boring and some kids are just to lazy to do something for the community. ,Counterclaim
Some people ask how community service could benefit our school. ,Counterclaim
"Sometimes children and teenagers like to use the excuse ""I don't have time for that"" or ""If i do community service, i wont ever get to hang out with my friends."" ",Counterclaim
Now for someone who never does their school work does not have a job and just sits around on their lazy butts all day long those are the people that should be doing community service,Counterclaim
some people may disagree. This is because it uses their own time. ,Counterclaim
"Some kids think its a waste of time to help out around the community, when they have their own stuff to do or worry about. ",Counterclaim
One might argue that doing the community service would be a great learning experience that teaches of moral and ethical values. ,Counterclaim
I know a lot of people would say there way to busy to do community services.,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, there are some people that are not even interested in community service that don't care if the trash doesn't be picked up or even at least help the community in another way ",Counterclaim
When students say its a waste of time to help those less fortunate we have a problem.,Counterclaim
I bet that many of the students would think that doing the community service would just make them look very stupid to their friends. ,Counterclaim
As it is wonderful for a student to work hard during school hours and have the opportunity to treat themselves to these thing ,Counterclaim
"i know students have something better to do like, their homework, play video games, ",Counterclaim
You may think that it is alright to tell someone what they have to do because you think they need it.,Counterclaim
Some people think community service is a waste of time,Counterclaim
"Some people dislike community service since they like to be inside the whole day either in front of a television, on a computer, or playing a video game. So they think community service is boring and not worth their time, ",Counterclaim
Some people doesn't wannabe help or they have other things to do.,Counterclaim
"Don't get me wrong, I think community service is a necessity.",Counterclaim
I think that if you require students to volunteer for community service I know that some of them will be really mad because they think its a waste of time ,Counterclaim
"Although kids would love to sit on the couch and play video games or text on their phones,",Counterclaim
" Although some students find it a waste of time, ",Counterclaim
"Though I'm going against it, I'll still write you a pro about letting students take action on community service. ",Counterclaim
Some teacher say this is good because teacher want there students to go take care of there community,Counterclaim
It would be great if we had the time and energy to do it ,Counterclaim
Most student disagree with me because they say that it isn't their responsibility to pick up after someone else. ,Counterclaim
I know that all that you want to do is maybe give the students more discipline and maybe prepare or show them what life is or life will be like if you go down the wrong path.,Counterclaim
I know that most of the other students probably don't want to have that happen. ,Counterclaim
"Many people may think that community service is hard work and kids our age shouldn't be doing this, they should be in school learning for a better education. ",Counterclaim
The students may think it would be fun and a good idea. They think it would be getting them out of school,Counterclaim
Off course it was time consuming ,Counterclaim
"Yes it would take some time out of your life,",Counterclaim
there are those who do not want to help out.,Counterclaim
"The kids say they have better things to do or they have no time, ",Counterclaim
"Also the community service sounds like it takes a lot of effort,",Counterclaim
"Community service is very important, i think it is important because with out our communities we wouldn't have anyplace to live. I think that it is important to keep the community you live in clean because it is your community,",Counterclaim
"I think most students do not want to participate in these types of things because, they are just embarrassed or are not willing to help people out ",Counterclaim
Sometimes my friends don't like helping the community service because she doesn't care,Counterclaim
I don't think that all kids are going to agree with me.,Counterclaim
" But even if this service is not pleasant, ",Counterclaim
Some people think that community service is useless or a waste of time.,Counterclaim
Some may say that's its a waste of time and they could be out having fun with there friends or going to parties and what not. ,Counterclaim
but we both know how persistent someone can be.,Counterclaim
Other students don't volunteer in community service because they feel like its a waste of their time and they won't be able to do what they want. ,Counterclaim
many students believe community service is a waste of time. Most of those students spend their weekends sitting in front of a television screen.,Counterclaim
"I know that some of the students here already do community service for fun or even for projects for school, ",Counterclaim
Kids are saying it takes to much time way ,Counterclaim
Kids mite think your being unfair now,Counterclaim
The only thing that probably wouldn't be a good thing is if you made them do community service on weekends ,Counterclaim
You maybe want to change your life,Counterclaim
"Even though some people may think it is a waste of time,",Counterclaim
Most students will probably not want to do any community service because they are lazy and do not feel like helping out their own community. ,Counterclaim
"Of course, many students will not do any community service,",Counterclaim
"For the kids that do not want to perform community service, then its there choice. ",Counterclaim
I also see the other side of it on how if we have community service it can bring families together to do something nice for the community. ,Counterclaim
As much as it will keep kids out of trouble,Counterclaim
"But then again, a lot of people might not want to do it.",Counterclaim
The only problem is that it might conflict with extra curricular activities such as sports or competitions.,Counterclaim
"People may think that there should never be a reason to not help a person,",Counterclaim
Some people think that community service is a waste of time ,Counterclaim
Some kids say they don't have the time,Counterclaim
But if you have this attitude that nothing good will ever come out of helping someone you would be wrong. ,Counterclaim
"I understand that maybe it might be a bad idea because a lot of kids my age have a lot going on like basketball, baseball, football, school work, and much more. ",Counterclaim
Then there is the issue of students believing that community service takes too much of their free time. ,Counterclaim
Choosing to help the community and help to save our environment is a very noble thing to do. ,Counterclaim
"Others might disagree with my opinion,",Counterclaim
It may help the community if students were required to do community service,Counterclaim
"Also I think that community service is a good thing for our community and everyone who lives in our community,",Counterclaim
I can see why people say that community service isn't necessary. ,Counterclaim
"I know people think that picking up trash out of the streets is cruel,",Counterclaim
"Of course, those who choose to volunteer for community service find their way; they figure out their own schedule. ",Counterclaim
 Of course you can prevent that by actually doing them in first place; ,Counterclaim
 I understand that not everybody has a lot of time on their hands with sports and all different types of activities ,Counterclaim
On the other hand making kids do community service no matter what could be a good thing. ,Counterclaim
"It does take time away from you, ",Counterclaim
. I understand it might help the community a little ,Counterclaim
. Most students say that its to much work and we don't get anything from it.,Counterclaim
some people may think Community Service takes to much time up for then,Counterclaim
Some friends and family may not care for community service ,Counterclaim
"
By doing community service not only are you impacting the person next to you, your also impacting the entire community. Doing something that helps can make you feel good on the inside ",Counterclaim
"Some students may say ""but, I just don't have time"". ",Counterclaim
I know some kids might be upset with this,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, every student performing community service will help the city extremely well. ",Counterclaim
some of the other students think it is a complete waste of time,Counterclaim
"I realize some people may think that community service is a waste of time, a distraction from work or friends and family ",Counterclaim
Community service may take sometime of what we want to do,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, I do see helping the community as an important issue.",Counterclaim
Community work does take up a lot of your time of hanging out with friends and doing your homework.,Counterclaim
"I'm not saying nobody should help out,",Counterclaim
"For students who don't want to do it because they got things to do, want to do, or just don't want to do it are just plain selfish.
",Counterclaim
"The students who don't like it say ""it takes too much time away from what they need or want to do"" ",Counterclaim
"Although this could benefit in many ways like helping make students more responsible, ",Counterclaim
" I know that they may have stuff to do with friends,",Counterclaim
People really don't care about community service because they feel like it really doesn't effect them ,Counterclaim
Sure some kids won't like it,Counterclaim
"Although it may seem like the right thing to do for our community, and you may feel you are teaching the students discipline and how to be helpful, ",Counterclaim
"Some people think its a great i idea to do community service,",Counterclaim
sure some would have there moans and disagreements and maybe not do anything to help,Counterclaim
I'm not sure how you could make everyone do community service because some students have after school activities and you can't make them stop for other people. ,Counterclaim
Kids might see it as a waste off time,Counterclaim
"For the people who think community service is really weird, t",Counterclaim
"Some students think community service is pointless and in some cases, uncool. ",Counterclaim
"Yes, this may take time away from doing what we want to do, like going to the movies with friends, or hanging out,",Counterclaim
"I know it is great to help out the community, ",Counterclaim
I understand that if a student have to have some kind of punishment and have to community service ,Counterclaim
"As you can see, community service could have an impact on students. It could make the community better,",Counterclaim
First of all I would like to say that I believe that community service is very important.,Counterclaim
"Some people laugh at people doing community service, ",Counterclaim
Even though it is a great way to meet new people and is a very honourable action ,Counterclaim
"If you made community service as a way to get high school credits however, I think that everyone will be very happy.",Counterclaim
a lot of students claim they don't have enough time. ,Counterclaim
 Just because some kids are complaining that they have to much homework or to many practices,Counterclaim
"But like I said others may not have time to do community service.
",Counterclaim
The only thing that may be wrong about it is the whole work time.,Counterclaim
I believe that it would be good for kids to half to do work ,Counterclaim
It may not be the funnest thing ever,Counterclaim
"You may think that community service is boring and a waist of time,",Counterclaim
"Now don't get me wrong, I think community service is a great idea. ",Counterclaim
"Though, as I look at my peers they think community service is something like a ""scandal"", which influences others, such as myself to not go on with these deeds ",Counterclaim
I know that would help some students that are going to college on a academic and sports scholarship ,Counterclaim
Some people say that it is a waist of time to be helping the community and the world they think that that's why their are people to work and take the trash out and stuff like that.,Counterclaim
But i think if they got in a fight or just a bad kid I would agree that they should do community service on school grounds because OSS is just happy for those kids and they are fine with that ,Counterclaim
I think that it is great they want to help but everyone should not be told what to do like i under stand if it is our parents because they are feeding us housing us and also clothing us when they say pick the trash up an all of the other stuff.,Counterclaim
Some of the students believe that it should not be available at al ,Counterclaim
Even though some people may think it is a pretty big time waster ,Counterclaim
"The people who don't like the idea usually become pessimists who hate everything,",Counterclaim
Some students perform community service. Some tutor elementary students and others clean up litter. They take this task seriously.,Counterclaim
and yes i understand where it takes a lot of there time,Counterclaim
Helping out others could really be a drag sometimes,Counterclaim
Other students might think it lame or rather do other stuff.,Counterclaim
Other than that I do not see a very good reason to require us to do community work ,Counterclaim
"If it were required, some students may not enjoy it at first,",Counterclaim
"There are of course dangers that come along with the tough job of helping our community, an example would be, predators prowling the area ",Counterclaim
"Also, students may turn a blind eye if they want to help, so they will fit in with their crowd of friends. ",Counterclaim
"Sometimes people think that doing community service its a wastes of time, other think they don't care if the city is clean or dirty they only care about them and no-one else. They may think about other stuff that's supposedly more important then helping or doing community service. :",Counterclaim
" I understand why people may not want to do community service, because they have there own life to take care not pick up after other humans.",Counterclaim
now i know i was all into it at the time when we started with a few of my friends,Counterclaim
" But also another reason why I'm against this idea is that most citys pay a crew to drive around town, water plants, clean town monuments, pick up liter, etc. this could potentially take away their jobs ",Counterclaim
But that isnt always what its about and the students should have an option to.,Counterclaim
"Many students think its a waste of time,",Counterclaim
They might not want to do community service,Counterclaim
"However, some people do not want to because they have things to do. ",Counterclaim
"It might seem like the right thing for everyone to do,",Counterclaim
"So many students do not wish to, or may not have time to, participate in community service. ",Counterclaim
Parents of these children would be upset that they are being taken away to do community service when they are needed at home. ,Counterclaim
Even though it takes up your time,Counterclaim
It would be nice if everyone would help other people by doing community work ,Counterclaim
The worst thing that can go wrong for you by giving them the option is that maybe just 10 kids take place in what you want them to do ,Counterclaim
Other people may think that this is absurd work ,Counterclaim
"Though most people would be disgusted by the idea of picking up trash at the beach or helping out at retirement home, ",Counterclaim
While the argument against students being required to do community service is that they would not have time for other things that they want or need to do. ,Counterclaim
"Some people might say that they can make room, ",Counterclaim
" Some people might say they can switch to another activity,",Counterclaim
"I also know some kids wont be happy about this,",Counterclaim
"I also very well understand that the kids have other priorities on there schedule, ",Counterclaim
Some kids think it takes up from being with friends or just staying home ,Counterclaim
for those who believe that community service is a waste of their time ,Counterclaim
 unfortunately other students think its a waste of time and will refuse to do i,Counterclaim
"Yes, i know community service is something to better build your character,",Counterclaim
Other people don't do it because they just want money and don't care about anyone but themselves ,Counterclaim
"Some people might not like it at first, like if there helping the less fortunate.",Counterclaim
"
Community service does take up some time. But some people don't want to do it is because they would rather be lazy at home and watch t. v. or play video games. But some people might even be busy.",Counterclaim
But some might say it takes up their planning time,Counterclaim
"First, I would like to point out that yes, community service does teach children that there are things that need to be done in our community and it does also teach good character. ",Counterclaim
Other teenagers might think that it is all fun and games ,Counterclaim
"I think doing community service is great and that kids should at least do some.
",Counterclaim
But then there or those kids who don't want do anything because their lazy or cause they have disability's,Counterclaim
"I know a lot of kids don't want to ""waste their time"" with such trivial odd-jobs, ",Counterclaim
"In some cases kids think that community service is a waste of time and that they are above helping others, ",Counterclaim
Some of my friends think that this takes to much of our time ,Counterclaim
"Anyone can think of it as hard unneeded labor, but on the contrary",Counterclaim
A student may believe doing community service is a waist of time. By them thinking that they are already going down the wrong road. A road of laziness and every thing being a waist of time. ,Counterclaim
I understand many students are not open to this idea or don't want to work out side of school.,Counterclaim
People who think the community doesn't help them,Counterclaim
"I wonder what kids think of when they say the community takes time from what I need or want to do.
",Counterclaim
but I also think student shouldn't have to do community service because some student play sports and have homework every day.,Counterclaim
I do know that community service is great for helping other people or just cleaning around ,Counterclaim
Now there are only a few flaws with this. ,Counterclaim
"I also understand that many adults, like yourself, do not have the time to go and pick up trash on the side of the road,",Counterclaim
Though some students may feel that community service is a waste of their free time,Counterclaim
"And I'm sure there will be some students that think it's a total waste of time, ",Counterclaim
Maybe a better thing that you can try to do with community service is maybe make a sign up sheet where all the students that actually want to help people and actually want to help their community can just sign up to do their community service to help.,Counterclaim
Some kids think community service takes too much of their time.,Counterclaim
Now some of my friends think it's really important and that others should do it. On the otherhand my other friends think it's a waste of their time.,Counterclaim
Now the reasons other people don't want to do it is because they think it's not mandatory,Counterclaim
the other reason why they don't want to it is because they have no time and they need to do homework or study or they have practice for games.,Counterclaim
"You may be coming to the idea that it is the students' fault for not being able to have time after school, and maybe in some cases it is.",Counterclaim
" Some of my friends disagree with me about community service,",Counterclaim
Community service is great and all ,Counterclaim
Some students think that doing stuff like that is boring because their not getting paid.,Counterclaim
I can also see how some students would not want to do this. ,Counterclaim
Although some parts of community service is expectable.,Counterclaim
Now i' m not saying that there isn't a little bit of slacker in every one,Counterclaim
"Now, i believe that some of the kids here at school may not want to be part part of this community service. I think that some kids may think that they have better things to do than community service",Counterclaim
"The others, like myself, are already participating in things, and it puts more of a burden on us having community service to do on top of sports, homework, and assisting your parents. ",Counterclaim
"Some excuses might be, "" I have too much homework to do after school"", or "" I already participate in many after school activities, isn't that enough""?",Counterclaim
Other kids don't want to do community service because they think it is a waste of time. ,Counterclaim
But some kids think that it is just a waste of time and they say that they have more important things to do. ,Counterclaim
"Although many would argue that the parents should hire a professional or that kids could clean on weekends,",Counterclaim
Yes community service would be nice,Counterclaim
Of course I love helping others ,Counterclaim
" I enjoy tutoring kids, and picking up trash",Counterclaim
"I think if you encouraged us a little more, some would find the time for it. ",Counterclaim
"Not every student in our school will agree, but several also may. ",Counterclaim
but we can also benefit from it ,Counterclaim
 I do see that other children may have things going on in their lives like sports or family.,Counterclaim
 If they don't have time out of school ,Counterclaim
If they cant like they have a family member in the hospital,Counterclaim
but also children like to have time to do fun things. ,Counterclaim
Some people said that it would be a waste of their time to do community service. ,Counterclaim
"When people think about community service, most people would think of punishment; something that juvenile delinquents does as a punishment ",Counterclaim
"on the other hand there are the people who go home blow off their homework and either hang out with friends or play video games, ",Counterclaim
You may say that forcing kids to do community service is the only way they'll do it. ,Counterclaim
disapprove because they all think its a waste of time and they have better things to do.,Counterclaim
I can see your point of view and how we should all help out and do our share to help the environment. ,Counterclaim
"but most us ""the students""

cannot be able to do this type of work after school. unless is during school time?",Counterclaim
"Although I personally hold an opinion that community service is the way to go, others may hold an opinion of their own. ",Counterclaim
But others think it takes too much time away from what they need or want to do .,Counterclaim
"I understand that there are those of you who will disagree that TEACHER_NAME

should require all students to perform community service ,",Counterclaim
But there will be some people that will probably disagree with me. There will be lazy people that will not do it.,Counterclaim
I also do agree with the other side of the argument. I agree with the other side because like me many people are very busy with school already ,Counterclaim
Now you may say that we aren't punishing them and that it teaches them to keep the environment clean.,Counterclaim
They shouldn't think community service is just a waste of time,Counterclaim
Some of the kids say that they don't have time to do community service but they can make time.,Counterclaim
Some may not want to because they might think it takes to much time.,Counterclaim
"Community service might build character,",Counterclaim
"Kids think that doing this is stupid and they shouldn't have to, ",Counterclaim
A popular reason why many student's don't want to do community service is because it's not something they want to do. they think it takes too much work and too much time out of their day.,Counterclaim
Though great experiences and feelings can come from doing community service bad ones can too. ,Counterclaim
"Some might argue that community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do,",Counterclaim
I am not saying that community service is bad.,Counterclaim
"I think that the students today are worried about sports, and not being able to help the community because of these jobs. ",Counterclaim
"Personally, I think it is great that some people like helping others,",Counterclaim
"Let me begin by saying that I do not disagree with those who dislike community service. I dislike it as well. It is a waste of time, and if I had it my way I would not require children to perform community service ",Counterclaim
" It may take time out of their lives, (not that many middle school students have ""lives"" out of school anyways) ",Counterclaim
"Sure kids have homework that they say they need to get done,",Counterclaim
"Of course some students wouldn't like that,",Counterclaim
"some people complain of what they have and what they don't have, ",Counterclaim
how hard it is to keep on cleaning everyday of their life.,Counterclaim
But sometimes people don't have the time to help out,Counterclaim
"Some people are just to busy to devote their time to community service because they could be taking care of their children, or doing sport activities, they could be doing college work or even homework. ",Counterclaim
for those who think community and service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, some kids think that community service takes too long. ",Counterclaim
It would be different if the students were making a mess and trashing the school on purpose then they should do community service,Counterclaim
 I know some people that already do community service and they love it they say that it is a good thing to do and they enjoy helping people in need.,Counterclaim
All though community service looks good on your college application so children should try to participate with community service,Counterclaim
having the transportation to get to where you need to go in order to be able to help out can be a problem.,Counterclaim
Sometimes i believe that when the students hear community service they think of exhausting hard work.,Counterclaim
sometimes the work is not always enjoyable,Counterclaim
 Of coarse not all students will want to participate in these activities but ,Counterclaim
"if people like bullies and rude and discourteous people don't help then they should have the right to choose or decide what they want to weather its to help or to not help,",Counterclaim
some people prefer to spend there time doing thing that help there self.,Counterclaim
Students think community center takes their time away.,Counterclaim
Some students don't participate because their friends say its waste of time.,Counterclaim
"some student might say why is the community important anyways, were fine nothing is wrong. ",Counterclaim
Those who think is bad i guess they like living in a dirty place.,Counterclaim
Some kids don't have enough time there either to busy with sports or x box or something ,Counterclaim
I all so understand that it is very important to do community service around the school and you can learn many things from doing community service ,Counterclaim
Many students think that littering is a fun thing to do.,Counterclaim
I understand that some people think that community service is a waste of time.,Counterclaim
Some people might just think community service takes too much time away from what they have to do and is a waste of time ,Counterclaim
"I understand some kids are against the idea of community service,",Counterclaim
Although sports can get you scholarships to college,Counterclaim
"I know you want kids to succeed in life,",Counterclaim
" Of course, you probably already know that the students who play sports or other activities who have a grade lower then a B are going to be mad at first.",Counterclaim
or it could work and people bring their grade up. so they can play on the team.,Counterclaim
Now I can understand why you would change the policy for people who don't care about they're grade's and don't care to keep them up.,Counterclaim
If you made it to where kids with C grades couldn't play sports it would may make some of them try a little bit harder ,Counterclaim
"You should have good grades,",Counterclaim
Then there are the kids who have so much to do that there grades are slipping which is unacceptable for the school standards,Counterclaim
Of course if you put up the standard they have to have in order to participate maybe they will try harder than what they usually try and get a B or even an A. ,Counterclaim
I know it is hard for a team when there best player cant play because of grades,Counterclaim
"Many kids or teenagers don't rely on their knowledge to get into a Division 1 college, they use their talent, skills, and special gifts to get them their. ",Counterclaim
I believe that it would help a little because it would help make your grades better and give you a better understanding of what you have to do,Counterclaim
"I agree that the students should have to work hard to be eligible for said reasons,",Counterclaim
"But in a different case that would be a smart idea.
",Counterclaim
I understand that you expect your students to show good character and progress.,Counterclaim
"I do understand that academics come first and i respect that, ",Counterclaim
"Although I support your decision, there is something that is bothering me a little. I think that for those students with a C average is not fair to not be able to enroll in any school activity. In my opinion a C average is not bad.",Counterclaim
I personally don't play much sports so this wouldn't effect me,Counterclaim
" And so while some people may argue against this rule, claiming it is unfair to require certain grades just to play a sport, act in a play, or participate in other activities",Counterclaim
I can understand that they have C' s,Counterclaim
I hope that the principal does not change the school policy.,Counterclaim
"Sure it would be nice to allow kids, who have a C in every subject, participate in an exciting sport or activity ",Counterclaim
In some ways this could also be a bad idea.,Counterclaim
"I understand that one believes that by not allowing students to participate in sports or other activities will limit their focus to school work, therefore allowing more time towards education ",Counterclaim
"i understand why you want your students to have a good B average. It makes the school look very good but also you will have more people trying there best on tests, quizzes or in classes generally.",Counterclaim
"Yes, some kids are lazy and don't do anything or even try to study for a test or quiz, ",Counterclaim
". On the downside, there will be a few students who will not want to work to get the B average and they will not participate in sports or other activities.",Counterclaim
Although parents think that this idea is appropriate ,Counterclaim
this school policy change could help out students. Since the grade average requirement would be bumped up from a C to a B students are definitely going to have to work harder. This could help out on the school's overall academic scoring. There would be more B grades than C.,Counterclaim
know i am not saying the C has to be a lowC going to a D because that is not acceptable,Counterclaim
I know school work is more important than sports,Counterclaim
I'm not saying we don't need this new grading system.,Counterclaim
Now one might say that not all athletes just sit back.,Counterclaim
We might lose some key players ,Counterclaim
"The only bad thing is that people might move to different schools and then we would start to lose funding after enough people left, ",Counterclaim
maintaining a B average can also help you ,Counterclaim
maintaining good grades would help a lot not just to the students but also to the school.,Counterclaim
 More students need to pay more attention to school so they can be in sports. ,Counterclaim
Sports is a great way for students to get a great education and to maybe someday get a scholarship to college ,Counterclaim
"So some people might disagree. They might say that some students that have a C average are really good athletes, and if they don't make the team, then the team will fail. ",Counterclaim
" some people might say that they can't do any better. Their parents were dumb, and so were they. Look at that self-confidence.",Counterclaim
"Many student athletes feel they need special treatment just because there are in fact special; being a student athlete means you can do things that others can't! Because of that mindset, these students don't always believe that education is important to their future. ",Counterclaim
Some might argue that with sports they don't have enough time for school work.,Counterclaim
"With that been said, a C average is not necessarily good for some students, because they are capable of doing better.",Counterclaim
your probably changing it to try to make the C average student to try harder to get better grades ,Counterclaim
I do get the side you are coming from to principal. I understand that you want to set a higher average on the students so they will try harder.,Counterclaim
"Though I do have one suggestion that would improve the rule and possibly your popularity and image in the school. Have the rule not take affect until the end of next term,",Counterclaim
"There is another question that should be answered, will the rule still be in effect for students with special needs? Personally I do not believe that it should be the same, there should be some slight changes. ",Counterclaim
but they might also not want to do sports because of their grades,Counterclaim
 Some may think that this policy is a burdened,Counterclaim
Yeah I know the teachers might want us to do better in school ,Counterclaim
"The bad thing in this is that some parents mite think it is a bad thing because they know there kid is doing there best but is not making a B so they cant play sports, so you mite have issues with that.",Counterclaim
I also think if u do that some kids will not try and u would not have as many players so u will have a smaller team for every thing ,Counterclaim
"Some can do better, I know, others are just not trying hard enough; ",Counterclaim
"Altho it may inspire some people to work harder,",Counterclaim
"I understand you want us students, to have very good grades ",Counterclaim
"I know you are thinking that school is more important that sports, and most parents would agree with you,",Counterclaim
Sure the students may not like it,Counterclaim
"or you can talk to the principal and try to change his mind and get people to play, or you can talk to the teachers and get them to change his mind",Counterclaim
if you do good in school that mite do the trick to.,Counterclaim
"I do understand that there are students who just don't understand the work,",Counterclaim
yes there are some kids who don't even try ,Counterclaim
" I understand the need for a good education,",Counterclaim
 I know you may think having the requirements of have a C will maybe let them think they must not try harder in their work or studies ,Counterclaim
" I can see how you think that sports may lower their grades even more, being too much of a distraction",Counterclaim
Although the grades do matter in ways. ,Counterclaim
I'll agree that it is a smart idea to change the policy so that students will do better ,Counterclaim
"It doesn't matter if they have a high C, but then need to have a B. Most students would argue about having to study ",Counterclaim
"but if for some reason, those people who tried their best, like they went to tutoring, did all their home and school work, and turned it in, then you might want to check in with his/her teachers and see if they want to let them participate,",Counterclaim
"but if they keep on complaining, and they don't actually try to do their best, and they slack off, go to sleep in class they you won't see a difference n their grades,",Counterclaim
 Although many think that it is good for a student to have a B average in all their classes ,Counterclaim
In some ways I agree with this change. Education is more important than other activities.,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, students or parents may believe that changing this policy may help our school achieve higher test scores. ",Counterclaim
" Another example is , parents may not want students to play sports with a C average grade, because that means that the student is barely passing",Counterclaim
" Lastly, a parent may want his or her child to continue with high grades, not just barely passing, but just completely passing. ",Counterclaim
I also see why you should not make that choice based on the effect it will have on the students  ,Counterclaim
"I could sort of see why you have to have good grades thought just because whenever you're playing a sport it's with a school team, so therefor you have to be a good role model for your teamates rather then getting in trouble all the time and failing every single class.",Counterclaim
"I understand that you want all of the students in this school to put their best foot forward and try for the best,",Counterclaim
playing sports is a good thing for if a person wants a wants a scholarship to a university ,Counterclaim
but it might be to hard for kids to do. ,Counterclaim
"There is also another side to the story however.

What to do about the students who don't give academics their all? ",Counterclaim
I also understand that some students might find it hard to keep a B average.,Counterclaim
even though there are some children out there that really needs help with their academic work,Counterclaim
This may be a good idea because it will make students work harder on their school work so that they will be able to try out for the school team.,Counterclaim
parents will probably like it because then they wont have to bother their child trying to get them to do the homework.,Counterclaim
"Personally, I probably would work harder so that i can stay on the team so that I will continue to be active and healthy.",Counterclaim
i know you want us to do well and all ,Counterclaim
"now on the other hand, for a failing student, consequence like being unable to participate in non school related activities can be applied doing that it way be like taking a privilege that they may not deserve away from them.",Counterclaim
" I think that's really good idea, it'll motivate students to try harder.",Counterclaim
Although I do agree with you that if they do not have good grades and if they have to many U' s then they should not be eligible to play. ,Counterclaim
 i don't think it would be a good idea to do this because if the kid would give up and not try because the teacher or the principle will take them out of their sport. ,Counterclaim
i think lowering it down to a c- would work,Counterclaim
"this policy might make you think it would encourage kids to have better grades,",Counterclaim
But I think it is a good reason why it has to be a B average it's because if u have a B or below than a B u can get kicked off the team or your activity.,Counterclaim
"But they might get at least a

B- or an A-. Like for example lets say they got an F and the next day they brung up that F to a B.",Counterclaim
But having as C average and not being able to play sports i think is unreasonable. So having that policy is a good thing. But it can be bad at a certain point because having to have at least a B average is kind of high ,Counterclaim
 Yes The policy is agreeable and it has benefits to make students get better grades. Yes it is going to make students try harder in the classroom.,Counterclaim
 Grades do matter a lot,Counterclaim
Yes i know grades are important to,Counterclaim
" I see some people might get upset because sometimes it might be the ""Star Player"" making that C average",Counterclaim
"Many students would go against this policy change because they know that they make C averages in some of their classes. Other students go against this because they know that their ""star player"" is one of those students that don't care about their grades and only care about their future with sports",Counterclaim
Many students do not like your idea,Counterclaim
"Yes, some students might not be as devoted as other students to get their work done",Counterclaim
 it may be a good idea if the school is doing bad like kid are getting d and F 's. it may improve kids in there work so they will get a and B 's it will be for the best.,Counterclaim
"I support your policy 100%, but there could possibly be bad outcomes as well.",Counterclaim
"I can see why you would want to keep students grades up and keep the student body as smart and hard working as possible, ",Counterclaim
"Some may argue that it is not fair to the students that have learning disabilities, who already have a hard time maintaining a C average as it is.",Counterclaim
 I know a lot of kids will think it's a bad thing ,Counterclaim
Yes there are a majority of students that have B averages,Counterclaim
Yes some kids and parents could argue that the athletes should be smart and well educated,Counterclaim
"You might say that school is more important than anything else and that if we do not have enough time to do our homework, that we should just quit, or stop attending those extra activities",Counterclaim
"Then again some of the teams best players may not be able to make a B average. this will make teams much small and sports not near as exciting or fun for the spectators who watch these games. very many parents my not be happy about their child not being able to play on a team, ",Counterclaim
On the other hand their will be many mad students and parents because that student is not able to play the sport that he or she may love. and also the coaches may get mad too because one of his or her best plays may not be making the grades that he or she needs to make to play this sport. ,Counterclaim
"Of course, changing the policy might make them work harder",Counterclaim
Students may see a positive change in there grade average,Counterclaim
"
There is also one downfall for changing the policy. If you make the policy stricter than some students may not want to do sports and some students may become over weight",Counterclaim
"The ones against the new rule is thinking that you're doing it just to make them suffer,",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, middle schools with their own sports programs can do this. ",Counterclaim
"Some say that sports cause kids to not focus on school as much and that by forcing them to have higher grades before they can join you get immediate results, ",Counterclaim
"Sure you are required to get good grades to even graduate or go to college,",Counterclaim
"Yet , there is one flaw . children who are passing at a C average and stay at a C average will not get a chance to be a part of their favorite activities .",Counterclaim
"Indeed some of my fellow students will not feel the same way. Some of them will say that then a student athlete is expected to do more than an average student,",Counterclaim
Some could say that it is not fair to some of the athletes that usually get C'  ,Counterclaim
"As I said before though students in this school have a grade C average. I know that most kids would disagree with this policy because they won't want to work for a B average.
",Counterclaim
I believe you are right for stopping at the common grade to prevent further failure and from this certain point on students should be asked to focus their views on school work.,Counterclaim
Teachers say well if we keep on letting them play their sport then they wont try to keep their grades up at all ,Counterclaim
My other point of view on your idea is that perhaps if they do care for sports so much this would be a bit of a drive for them and they would want to be on the sports team so it would be a win-win situation for both of you.,Counterclaim
You just want to help raise the students grades up.,Counterclaim
There are some bad sides to this issue but there is also good reasoning to this. After all why should kids who don't care about school be aloud to join a sports team? The ability to do a sport is a privilege and they should work for it.,Counterclaim
Many students in our school have a C average. Which means that a lot of people in the school could not play any sports or activities. ,Counterclaim
"But i have a stand point of where your coming from, it's a privilege to be in a sport and if you can't show your teachers you can get a good grade in their class, then how do you know your going to be good on the team.",Counterclaim
I still don't like the idea but i understand what you are doing. If a student wants to play sports that bad they do there hardest to raise there grade up. That a good motivation thing to do to get the students up. If half 75% students are playing sports that means they are making good grades.,Counterclaim
"Although many people think of extracurricular activities as rewarding for bad grades,",Counterclaim
I know that it would make the school look better ,Counterclaim
"Grades are important,",Counterclaim
I could understand the fact of kid aren't putting enough effort into their work ,Counterclaim
"Yes, i do know it is tremendously important to keep on your grades at all times to be able to succeed in life",Counterclaim
"Maybe you ask ""What if someone has the potential in playing but doesn't have the grades"" ",Counterclaim
"On the other hand though, not every kid is good at every subject. If kids try their best on the subject and still don't get a grade B average, this wouldn't be fair to them.",Counterclaim
Well yeah it might help them pass there classes but still.,Counterclaim
. But you know what principal at the same time you have a point because if we really care about our grades and about playing sports i think that's a okay thing to do because it would really help some people and we will be improving a lot well them after sports are over some people might have really grades.,Counterclaim
"But then again, it may push students to work hard and it may bring students grades up cause they want to participate in things.",Counterclaim
 I know you want all of your students to have high grades and what not,Counterclaim
this could be good thing motivating the students. ,Counterclaim
Even though It's important to maintain good grades ,Counterclaim
"Yes, it is important for students to have good grades ",Counterclaim
But that might just be to me imp not sure about the other students,Counterclaim
I know if you do intend to proceed in changing the policy we students will try to get better grades to play the sport,Counterclaim
Many students believe the policy should be changed ,Counterclaim
"I know what you are thinking.

you are thinking, why can't they run on their own. ",Counterclaim
 We should change it though cause it might pressure the students to get higher grades to participate in a sport. The school may also have a higher percent of students passing and less students failing... Which would help the school get a higher score at the end of the year.,Counterclaim
"Even though sports is healthy for kids, a lot of students should be able to attend to those activity's ",Counterclaim
"Now don't me wrong, i' d want better",Counterclaim
"Yet, still their are people who may that "" most kids do not try their hardest"". ",Counterclaim
Though I do believe if a student loves their extra curricular activity so much they will get their grades up,Counterclaim
I mean yes don't get me wrong it would be amazing to have people to get all B' s and below.,Counterclaim
Some kids think it's unfair that they couldn't get into sports because of their grades ,Counterclaim
The schools are trying to promote a healthier life style ,Counterclaim
If you think that this will pressure kids into doing more work and trying harder,Counterclaim
If we had a D or an F i would understand that,Counterclaim
"I also understand why you are changing the school policy, to ensure that if you want to participate in school funded activities you must maintain a reasonable grade level ",Counterclaim
"Sure lot's of people say you don't NEED exercise,",Counterclaim
I do understand some reasoning for why you want students to have a B average to play sports.,Counterclaim
But then again some kids might not tryout for the team because they probably don't like to study or do homework so they wont get a B average ,Counterclaim
I do agree that with some students earning F's and D's it's because they do not complete their work and do not try to pay attention.,Counterclaim
This may result in smarter students,Counterclaim
" I get that it is very important to have good grades especially when your in high school, so that could help you get into college. If it helps for students improve on there grades then i would agree with the B average idea ",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, it could be a bad thing because some people are trying their hardest but they just can't get the b average and they should be able to play sports. ",Counterclaim
The idea of having players maintain a b average can also be a bad thing. ,Counterclaim
education and academics is more important than sports or other activities ,Counterclaim
"I understand where you are coming from. That not being able to play sports with a C average, students will want to do better",Counterclaim
I completely understand your decision ,Counterclaim
for some students school is hard for them.,Counterclaim
"Some people may argue that this new policy would put stress on student athletes, worrying about how they have to get good grades ",Counterclaim
"Yes, academics are important. ",Counterclaim
"Though, there are some dire consequences. For example, if students have to have a B average and are struggling making a C average but are trying their hardest, the students are more likely to just quit the sport. ",Counterclaim
 they probably would try to raise their grades. Many parents would probably try to get their kids to do better in school ,Counterclaim
But also there are some kids who are just plain lazy and get lucky by getting a C they will still get to play,Counterclaim
" But also many students have a grade of a (C)

or lower it would not be a good idea changing the policy sport grade for those students",Counterclaim
"This change would not effect much but for students who don't study this idea might not be good,",Counterclaim
I understand why you want to make that policy. You want your school to be recognized for having good grades but kids like to have fun. ,Counterclaim
"Pushing students to strive to get better grades is good, in fact, it's a, must.
",Counterclaim
" I can see why you might want to change it, maybe its because kids would work harder and try to bring their grades up to a B, which would be a lot better and they would learn a lot more ",Counterclaim
The schools have those kids that don't try or care,Counterclaim
"Well, I also disagree with your policy. I think if some kids really do struggle in school, they wont be able to participate in any other activities. I don't really think that is fully fair. ",Counterclaim
Even though some students will obviously disagree with this will help most of them.,Counterclaim
Yes you all are trying to make us smarter and make it to were going thru life is easier because we know most things is great,Counterclaim
of course you may still think this is a good solution ,Counterclaim
On the other hand there are peers of mine in the school who are academically challenged while doing all of the techniques I listed above. ,Counterclaim
Other people might say that would be a good idea.,Counterclaim
I could understand if they had only flawed grades which means their not trying hard enough ,Counterclaim
"You might see students walking around school thinking about sports or other activities ,and that will be the only thing that they will be having on their mind.",Counterclaim
"school is for the students to have and great education

I know",Counterclaim
"Now on the other hand i do realize and understand were your coming from TEACHER_NAME, some students don't deserve to go to extra activities or be on a team, ",Counterclaim
But some students might go against it.,Counterclaim
Another concern of yours may be that the students in the sports program may slack at school if you lower the grade level,Counterclaim
Principals and teachers think they will save money on banning the sports to lower level kids but they are wrong. ,Counterclaim
"Some people may say, that the school is expecting to much out of the students.",Counterclaim
"Yes, I agree that if students don't try at all in school then they should not be allowed to participate in school sports.",Counterclaim
"Some good reasons why this could be a good thing, one way that this could help the school out is having these kids that play sports and interact with other activities.",Counterclaim
"But in the other hand the students that do receive a B average or higher should deserve a little price saying ""good job"" for their hard work and effort ",Counterclaim
"I know your just doing it for us; to make sure we all have good grades, and eventually do something we want to do in the future ",Counterclaim
"Though your policy would encourage students to keep good grades, ",Counterclaim
Students may think of this policy unfair,Counterclaim
But I also think that not everybody are going to be happy ,Counterclaim
"I understand that someone's grades may be more important to you than sports,",Counterclaim
Yes i do see why you would want to change. because if you change the people with a grade lower than a B would try to get the grade up and keep it there,Counterclaim
It can also be a good thing.,Counterclaim
many of the students grades start to go up when the do sports and many other activities since many of the sports wont let you play unless you have a average of C possibly a B and if it turns out that is what it is going to happen then they would try harder and their grades go up.,Counterclaim
"Sure some kids would work harder in order to play, ",Counterclaim
" Although these are great reasons some people may think, this new policy might be unfair because everyone should be allowed to participate, ",Counterclaim
"Other student's opinion's count and I'm pretty sure not everyone thinks this policy would be fair, they might argue that your grades shouldn't affect what activities you are allowed to be involved in.",Counterclaim
I agree that sports is good for the health,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, I see why you made this new rule. One reason is because it's not fair to the A average students to have worked so hard for their grades, those students deserve to play sports with students of the same grade level. Another way that the rule seemed necessary is because students that don't try to do good shouldn't have the privilege to play in sports or other after-school activities.",Counterclaim
"Work is still being done to perfect the driverless cars, even though some states such as : California, Neveda, Florida, and the District of Columbia have made it illegal to even test computer-driven cars.",Counterclaim
"Yes, driverless cars would be a huge advacement in this technology filled world,",Counterclaim
some may be concerned about the safety of driverless cars,Counterclaim
Being in a car that does all the work could get a little boring though i'll admit.,Counterclaim
"Many poeple argue that automated cars would be safer than a human driver. People are subject to risks such as distraction, drunk driving, and human error while machines are immune to such ailments. ",Counterclaim
Many people will apose the idea of developing the technology of cars. People believe that people will become lazy but the truth is people are already lazy. Many people die from car accidents and most of the time it is because someone was lazy to focus on the road instead of the radio or forgot that they were drinking.,Counterclaim
even though they are not actually 100 percent driverless ,Counterclaim
"Many people can argue and say ""wont drivers get bored of waiting for their turn to drive?""",Counterclaim
In many states it has been lawed that the use or attempt to make such cars is illegal ,Counterclaim
Manufactors are coming up with new techniques to help alert the driver of any danger that could possibly occur before the incident could even happen. ,Counterclaim
The only bad think about the driverless car would be if something failed than it would be the maufactures fault.,Counterclaim
"The opposing side would say that, at least the car has sensors that can alert the drivers when backing in and out a driveway oe parking space, or that they keep the drivers alert on the roads when the driver gets to close to another car or too close to the back of the car. ",Counterclaim
Everyone thinks theses cars are cool and will be better for everyone ,Counterclaim
Some people may say that times are changing and technology is at an all time high and they would be correct ,Counterclaim
The police force would have to watch out for distracted drivers that are on there cellular devices or even doing there make-up in the car,Counterclaim
but in the end everyone would get bored just sitting in the drivers seat while the car takes you wherever you want to go,Counterclaim
 Even if a driverless car was created certain states wouldn't let you drive it on their roads ,Counterclaim
"As i said there are benefits to this driverless car , while the car drives it self it provides enteratinment such as sound but when it is time for the driver to take over it turns everything off. This is a great idea because it creates less distraction for the driver. ",Counterclaim
A driverless car seems so cool and nobody would never have to really do anything. ,Counterclaim
My biggest concern about these cars are the liability in the case of an accident.,Counterclaim
"Now it's easy to believe why take the risk if it can end up worse,",Counterclaim
"I agree that there a many pros to go along with the Driverless Car. But with most pros, there is a con to go with it. A pro of the driverless car would be the stress relief. ",Counterclaim
Another pro would be simply how amazing it is that a car is actually driving itself. ,Counterclaim
"Secondly, the car may possibly be a good idea.",Counterclaim
 These cars can obviously save a lot of money for some people ,Counterclaim
drivers are still needed in certain situations. What's the point of driverless cars if there's still a need for a driver. ,Counterclaim
This is what I mean when I say what's the point of driverless cars if we're still basically driving the car. ,Counterclaim
Driving laws focus more on safety. Traffic laws state that the only safe car there is has a human driver in control at all times.,Counterclaim
"Driverless cars may seem new and exciting and it is, but they can also cause us harm. The driverless cars have tons of technology to it. It can help us break, notify us, drive us ,and it can take over the car. ",Counterclaim
It may also has the downs. Let's say that somone is on their way to the hospital rushing for a loved one who is terribly hurt. How does the driverless car react? ,Counterclaim
Some people do not like the idea of a self driving car because it takes the controle out of there own hands. ,Counterclaim
if experts are set on making them then they probably will,Counterclaim
I do believe there can be positives for a driverless car though. ,Counterclaim
Driverless cars sound efficient and luxurious ,Counterclaim
You might think that cars being controled by itself without the drivers would be facinating and cool for you,Counterclaim
"However, the driver is still necessary during times where the car is unable to fully process the situation, such as in work zones, and around accidents, still giving the driver a role in the operation of the car (7) ",Counterclaim
Some new laws will have to come with the production of the new driverless cars ,Counterclaim
Now I commend the enginers who have worked so hard on this facinating technology.,Counterclaim
"Yes, I do see how it would be nice getting to be driven around ",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, driverless cars would be good for people who have disabilities or any other problems that would hinder them from driving ",Counterclaim
" I understand that these cars would give you a form of entertainment to keep you occupied while in the vehicle, ",Counterclaim
"It is handy though, a car like this ",Counterclaim
"But it would be nice to not have to worry about other cars,
",Counterclaim
"Yes, they do get better gas millage",Counterclaim
Some reasons usually brought up that haven't been addressed yet are the issues of laziness with the animated movie WALL-E coming to mind ,Counterclaim
" the hacking of the systems that run these driverless cars, which is equally terrifying.",Counterclaim
although there are cons to driverless cars,Counterclaim
"The cars would make everyday life more simple and less stressful,",Counterclaim
So we all know how many safety concerns we face in cars when on the road and this is exactely why people believe we shouldnt have self driving cars.,Counterclaim
"Even though these are all good points to make about the driverless car, autonomously driving cars will not bring the driverless function untill the technology is available. If these driverless abilities malfuntion, people will get hurt with no idea if it was a driver or the computer had an issue. Alse, There will always have to be a driver alert for these cars to make the right decisions if there were to be crashes or construction sites. ",Counterclaim
" Although these would be some very helpful things and would be more economically friendly,",Counterclaim
"Driverless cars are definitely a good way in saving your time and energy,",Counterclaim
"i understand that most drivers are alert and ready when it comes to these types of situations,",Counterclaim
Yea driverless cars can drive themselfs ,Counterclaim
"Yes, I get that it would save fuel and be much more convenient for everyday life, ",Counterclaim
For some reason it would be a good idea because it would save fuel because they will only used half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more far flexibility. ,Counterclaim
There have been many bumps in the road for the developement of driverless cars.,Counterclaim
There are advantages with driverless cars ,Counterclaim
the people say it will make it safer,Counterclaim
 who will be at fault if the car crashes. ,Counterclaim
"Yes it will still need human assistnce once in a while during the times of ""...navigating through road work or accidents."" Which will keep the ddriver still in control and not putting others and themselves in danger. As said in the text ""The google car simply announces when the driver should be prepaired to take over."" ",Counterclaim
"Some people might disagree and say ""Why would we want a driverless car if its not completely driverless?""",Counterclaim
Several may argue that a driverless car is not safe. ,Counterclaim
"There is one problem though, does this give the people the idea of I can just sit back relax and not pay attention. The car will do everything for me ",Counterclaim
but a lot of people think it is very dangerous.,Counterclaim
 In the passage the bad thing is when coming upon construction is that the car will tell you when to start driving manually. The other bad thing is that you have to have your hands on the wheel at all times,Counterclaim
Some people may think that driverless cars are dangerous. Others may think that the driverless cars may cause more accidents.,Counterclaim
"However, there are people that think that being able to go somewhere in a car without having to actually drive it would be a great idea. ",Counterclaim
"However, a positive thing about having driverless cars is that people would not need to take drivers ed anymore ",Counterclaim
 Knowing you are in complete control can be a little scary. ,Counterclaim
I would rather drive my car than let a computer beacuse technology will always have problems and errors,Counterclaim
Driverless cars are very controvesial by many just because we have told for so long that the only way a car is safe is for it to be driven by an alert human being.,Counterclaim
I understand they think its cool and it will change the future,Counterclaim
"Positive things about the artical ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is that the cars have been driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Another thing is that in article it tells the reader about without the option of smarter roads, manufactors turned to smarter cars. I feel as both could of happened in a way and I feel that if we have smarter roads , manufactors wouldn't really have to worry about accidents happening or have to worry about the driver int eh car taking over in cause of a tight situation.",Counterclaim
" the car would be a success because of the sensors the car has, i feel that with sensos on the car manufactors wuldn't have to worry about the car getting into wreaks, and i feel as if the car would be able to drive through raods that are being worked on. Another positive thing about the driverless cars is that they are willing to make new laws for the car.",Counterclaim
Although I believe that there would be astonishing benifits with the Firefighters/Parametics using this equipment,Counterclaim
"Of course, people can argue that if a car were to drive itself, there would be less accidents. It is true that driverless cars could reduce accidents from drunk driving and other impaired states, or just simple driving errors.",Counterclaim
The idea of having a vehicle that you do not have to manage while on the roads sounds amazing to everyone.,Counterclaim
There are positive sides to the driverless cars though.,Counterclaim
"Some people still like to drive their own cars,",Counterclaim
on the oher hand these car are going to be expensive for the adverage human to buy. ,Counterclaim
people are scared that he computer in the car will be abel to get hacked or it will shut off when your driving and you could wreck there is many ways that he computer could mess up so that is also a dangerous part of having a car that drives its self. ,Counterclaim
Some people may agrue that letting a car be in control is just absurb. You never know what the car might do. ,Counterclaim
"However, these driverless cars are not completely hands-off. When greeted with the obstacle of road contruction or an accident, the human in the car must take over. ",Counterclaim
" you may have to get behind the wheel for a short period to help your car through traffic,",Counterclaim
The biggest problem with driverless cars is that it is difficult to enable them to manuever around unexpected problems like car accidents or construction areas. ,Counterclaim
"I think that with any type or design of vehicle procautions will have be taken into place and lots of research and factors will go into play. Many people are concerned about the liablities and if something would go wrong what they would do, who would be responsible. I believe that the damage and facts would have to be carefully examined, just like any car accident. ",Counterclaim
"Now, some people are saying ""well in the article it says that you need to be aware of you enviroment"" which in other words you need to know what is going on outside of your car",Counterclaim
"On paper, driverless cars seem like a great idea,",Counterclaim
"Technology advances on cars that will help with safety are always beneficial, ",Counterclaim
Even with all of these gadgets some people still think that self driving cars are a danger to people on the roads.,Counterclaim
The main problem for self driving cars is the Law.,Counterclaim
One could argue that roads would be safer with cars capable of driving themselves,Counterclaim
" If fuel is being reduced and citizens are easily able to get from point A to point B, the only con here is that there would be less jobs available for transport such as taxi drivers.",Counterclaim
Google cars are an amazing invention ,Counterclaim
"However, the act of driving a car is a dangerous one. ",Counterclaim
"Some may say that if self-driving cars were to be a common finding in life, roads and driving laws would need to be changed considerably. ",Counterclaim
"Yeah maybe i see where their coming from, not passing the law because if the technology fails and causes an accident .",Counterclaim
"yes, one could arugue the dangers of having a driveless car, since a driveless car is not the same as just having better brakes or a Google car that still has a human in control of it ",Counterclaim
These new cars have challeges to overcome and these challeges are the reason some oppose the idea ,Counterclaim
"I could agree with some things on the driveless cars. The first thing I can agree on is that it has sensors so that it can sense other cars coming towards it. I also like how they might be different versions to the self-driving cars, like som might be sensored or some might beamagnetized. Finally, I like how if you were to get in a tight spot, then the car will force you to do all the heavy lifting so you don't get hurt. ",Counterclaim
Driverless cars may still need modifications because there are still faults in dealing with traffic and roadwork. ,Counterclaim
"My counter-argument to my argument would be that there are plenty of sensors around the car stated in paragraph 4, ""...they needed a whole lot of sensors,""",Counterclaim
"They say that they plan to have these problems solved , & a handful of car companies plan to have cars that drive by themselves in a few years, but they get closer to where they want to be with this everyday. ",Counterclaim
" While some may state that automated cars can never reach the intuition and agility of a natural driver, ",Counterclaim
"The laws aginst the use of these ""Driverless"" cars are very reasonable too, and need to adjust for further research towards the safety of the people they aim to protect with these laws. ",Counterclaim
"Unfortunately, many of these same benefits offered by self-driving cars have a negative alter-ego. One of the major effects of increased automation is increased efficiency. However, as we move towards a fully automated world, we lose a lot of jobs in unspecialised industries. Laws would also have to be reworked for nearly every aspect of the traffic system. How and why would teenage drivers take a driving test if they're never going to have to drive a car? Will human drivers and AI drivers fall under the same category in the eyes of the law? There are still years and years of legal red tape that has to be cut through before self-driving cars can even make it onto the consumer market. In addition, there are soem ethical problems involved with programming self-driving cars. Programmers and developers could be a fault for deaths caused by bugs in their program. And what should you do if a crash is unavoidable? Should you sacrifice the passenger to save a pedestrian?",Counterclaim
"There are some negatives with the driverles car. If there is to much traffic, construction sight, or just something the automobile cannot handle then the driver will have to take over. ",Counterclaim
I see that if there was to be a wreck involving one of these cars it could easily be blamed on the manufacturer.,Counterclaim
Some say that this is a great idea but others would disagree ,Counterclaim
"Although I do think there are lots of cons to driverless cars, I do acknowledge the benefits.",Counterclaim
"Driverless cars are great, but like all great things there are some problems. The biggest problem is if a driverless car gets into a wreck whose problem is it the manufacteror or the driver. Another problem isthat many states do not believe driverless cars to be safe so they have not yet legalized them. ",Counterclaim
"In other hand, people disagree to develop the driverless cars. The text states, ""Why would anyone want a driverless cars that still needs a driver?"" They claimed that the driverless cars should do everything by itself instead having the dirver controlling it. They think there is no difference if we use a normal car",Counterclaim
I agree with this part because if the car is driving and he human is faling asleep then the cars with cameras will notify them by vibrating the seats and waking the person up. ,Counterclaim
"
Eventhough there are many possible problems of the Google car, there are a few positives. ",Counterclaim
It's ok to have a driverless car for long road trips because they could protect you more and react faster on a high way then on a everyday street that gets drove on everyday. I think the GM's idea on having the seat vibrate when backing up into a object is a great idea. ,Counterclaim
"However, they explain how great driverless cars are and how they will help many people when it comes to driving ",Counterclaim
Sure there are sensors to help with the saftey.,Counterclaim
"Driveless cars may seem appealing becuase of the convience of everyone have a personal taxi driver (the car itself),",Counterclaim
"Let's start off with the pros, because there definitely are some.",Counterclaim
" Sure, drunk drivers would be less of a problem",Counterclaim
maybe some people might think of using the self-controlled car at night when you are so tired that you can't drive anymore because that is dangerous.,Counterclaim
"although it may seem like a good idea, Alot of the men and women who drive these public trsnportation devices would be losing their jobs if people decide to not use them anymore becasue there is self sufficiant cars and they would complt to being forced to try to find another job which they might not be able to get. ",Counterclaim
"""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."", or so the article says in passage Eight. Some maufacturers hope to do that by bringing in car entertainment and information systems that use head on displays. Which can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over,",Counterclaim
"Now someone that would condone a driverless car would say, ""You would need to make sure everything is properly working before taking it out on the road.""",Counterclaim
Yeah the car would have its flaws ,Counterclaim
The only major bad thing about having one would be having to worry about serious accidents that might happen. ,Counterclaim
"Now I like that we have cars that will be able to make the roads safer with sensors. That's something we can capitilize on,",Counterclaim
The only solution that could possibly work is for manufactures to have cameras in the car watching the driver that is a positive.,Counterclaim
"On the other end of the argument, we haven't come that far to make a driverless car. Sometimes machines mess up and cause problems and that could happen to this. There should be a button or something like that to switch a driverless car back to a normal car. We just dont have enough technology to do a driverless car and to make one now would be dangerous. ",Counterclaim
"Sure, there would probably be less accidents and less rule breaking",Counterclaim
 The negative thing about driverless cars is that they still require humans. ,Counterclaim
Driverless cars also have a negative side. The cars still require a human to be alert in case he needs to take the wheel. ,Counterclaim
Maybe for older folks who have trouble or someone having so much money for one they just get one for the fact that they want to say that they have it. ,Counterclaim
"However, even though this technology offers so much to humanity, it could also take away. ",Counterclaim
There are many positives to this but I question how well the car would be able to keep the driver awake ,Counterclaim
 Another concern I would be afraid to get into a car that relies on so much more technology. ,Counterclaim
"The driverless car is not perfect, though. ",Counterclaim
Okay now you could that it would happen because of new computer software and it updates constantly. ,Counterclaim
"All of these advancements in the car industry sound like maufacturers could make the smarter driverless car by next week, but there are other opinions. ",Counterclaim
"People may be worried about the safety to,of course.",Counterclaim
The negitive part to this car is that it is probably really expensive. ,Counterclaim
The driverless car would be a really cool invention that could allow driver to relax but also cause more stress.,Counterclaim
" they use radars and those can cost two hundred million dollars, that right there is a down side.",Counterclaim
One of the biggest down fall is the law. ,Counterclaim
"Yes, having driverless cars makes us have to do less work. ",Counterclaim
 In some cases driverless cars do seem safe,Counterclaim
"While some people may see them as just another difficulty we would have to work out,",Counterclaim
"With all of the accidents that happen every day, would driverless cars cause more problems in comparison?",Counterclaim
Another problem would be the worry of hackers with technology today.,Counterclaim
" So will there still be law suits agaisnt companies if an accident does occur?

Well while technology advances our laws remain.",Counterclaim
Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems will be solved. However their technology won't be able to give the pleasure of driving to those who wish to drive.,Counterclaim
"Although driverless cars can help reduce the risk of accidents, other people believe the technology isn't safe enough for roads. The technology can fail at any moment and a crash or accident can occur. ",Counterclaim
"I believe that driverless cars could be a great benefit to this country, but they cannot replace all cars with them. ",Counterclaim
"This allows for some people to argue that driverless cars are not reliable,",Counterclaim
The problem with this is that the car needs some way of notifying the driver if he falls asleep. ,Counterclaim
"One big argument when it comes to driverless cars is the potential for an accident.

The worry is that if the technology in the car quits working and the car crashes, who do you blame? ",Counterclaim
The only flaw with autonomous car that I can visualize is the possible glitches in it's programing,Counterclaim
"Although, as the article states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault""",Counterclaim
"Now, some people may be questioning the cars' ability to drive, especially in unusual situations. It's a given that these cars wont originally be flawless, and that they'll need some help along the way.",Counterclaim
"Yes, you could sleep while you go to work ",Counterclaim
They also could have a negative affect on society just like in the late 1950's. ,Counterclaim
"The driverless car might not be a good idea because "" Even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident.",Counterclaim
"Dr. Werner Huber, BMV project manager driver, suggests that they just have to find a new way to interpret the driving fun. Companies suggest that insert certain in-car entertainment display, so when the driver needs to take over, it will turn of. Others are suggesting to install a seat that vibrates when the human driver needs to take control.",Counterclaim
"You might say that a driverless car is still illegal in most states. This is because it still has not been profected. The developers are still working to ensure that a driverless car is safe enough to be on the road at all times, in all situations. ",Counterclaim
 some may argue that the driver should never be resting and relaxing when at the wheel.,Counterclaim
"You might argue that humans driving have just as high of a risk, ",Counterclaim
" I, on the other hand, am not worried about that, becasue even if one car has a giltch there will be many other smartcars on the road to help avoid an accident. That's why these cars should definatley be on the road.
",Counterclaim
"Although they would make life easier soemtimes,",Counterclaim
What about being bored while your car drives itself? Doesn't a smart car take the fun out of driving?,Counterclaim
"While some may argue that the automation of the car takes away the factor of human error,",Counterclaim
Yes it might put some people out of jobs,Counterclaim
" Most humans, if you give them something that can make them have to work less, will rely souly on that one product to do all that it can possibly do to help them, but when that product has a malfunction it could be disasterous. ",Counterclaim
"To me, that's the only problem...the cars aren't fully in control ",Counterclaim
Some may say that driverless cars can actually help and are a good invention. They can make driving across the country or down to Florida for spring break much easier than having to sit and pay attention to the road for sixteen hours straight.,Counterclaim
"Machines are only as smart as the human making them.

So there could be flaws and mishaps that can occur,",Counterclaim
The idea of driverless cars can be dangerous in the matter of if something goes wrong and the driver is not alert it would cause an accendent. ,Counterclaim
"Others might argue, ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own,",Counterclaim
there are many people out there who believe driverless cars are the future. ,Counterclaim
"Just because there is driverless cars coming soon doesn't mean that people can just drive them around whenever they feel like it, its same as being a car when you have control. You still have to watch out and go the speed limit, you can't take it and sleep when it's driving. ",Counterclaim
"Have they thought about the car accidents that could happen? Or how it could injure someone? This will take more responsibility than what a driver has now.

Would there have to be any test taking for those who want their permit or license? How do you know if they are capable of being in control over those things? Having the cars we have now are good enough.",Counterclaim
Driverless cars may appeal to the younger generation because of the flahy technology ,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, driverless cars have multiple downsides, some aspects are clear improvements from automobiles today. ",Counterclaim
Althoug countries like Canada and Florida has made driveless cars illegal ,Counterclaim
So one thing that you might ask is well they have sensors that will keep everyone safe. ,Counterclaim
" The car seems like it would be helpful in certain areas, for example people with fatigue. they coulb be tired feeling like they're about to fall asleep. they have a car driving itself to the location. ",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, I can see how peope would be against this they may think it could cause more crashes. ",Counterclaim
 I can see someone's view that is against this as why would I want a driverless car if I still might have to drive it. ,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, someone who is against the driverless car might feel this is unsafe. ",Counterclaim
"Some might argue that driverless cars aren't truly autonomous yet, and that issues could appear if there is a system error with the car. ",Counterclaim
"Driverless cars dont just have cons though they have pros.

One pro is that if someones is drunk they can get in the car and not have to control it and having the risk on getting into a dangerous accident.

According to the text it says that the car system is a safety feature. ",Counterclaim
 A negative thing about having a driverless car is that drivers would get bored when waiting for their turn to drive.,Counterclaim
"From a devil's advocate perspective, the idea of these cars are actually quite neat to me.",Counterclaim
Even though you may get bored and want to drive ,Counterclaim
The question that may pop up in a lot of consumers mind is what if something goes wrong wit the system of the driveless car? ,Counterclaim
"Some people probably hate the idea of the car. Yes, there are cons to the car",Counterclaim
"Those who believe that driverless cars are a good thing for us would argue, ""Now the driving experience can be alot less boring and more enterianing."" Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver, says ""The psychological aspects of automation are reallly a challenge. We have to interpret the driving run in a new way."" Some manufactures want to successfully bring in-car entertainment to driverless cars to prevent people from getting bored",Counterclaim
"Some would also argue that technology is up to par and is able to handle driverless cars. The text states, ""Automakers are contining their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved.""",Counterclaim
the part that is good about the car telling the driver to help is it would keep the drivers alot more on the road then they would be if it could stop and pull over all on its own,Counterclaim
"Many thoughts and ideas about these driverless cars are genius. Who would not want a car that could drive itself? These cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themseleves. Driving the car still needs human access, but not like it would if these cars could do these things. Driverless cars could change the world as we know it",Counterclaim
"I understand that it would be fasinating to just be able to sit and look around at stuff on the way to your destination or even just relax. Why not just stop and explore? Why not just have gas stations fill up your gas for you, or even robots do your own homework or chores?
",Counterclaim
" In the future though, if kids grow up around driverless cars and aren't actually taught the rules of the road, then if there is an emergency that requires the drivers immediate attention as stated in the article, then the driver probably wouldn't know what to do.",Counterclaim
"I also think that driverless cars could be a great thing for the future of technology, but the question that is asked in paragraph 9 of the article is very important to keep in the minds of the car manufacturers. If people rely on their car to do the driving for them, then if there is a wreck who is a fault, the driver or the manufacturer?",Counterclaim
"The reasoning to make these cars is kind of crazy to think about, waking up in the morning knowing that you don't have to drive all the way to work. Sounds pretty good right?",Counterclaim
People may think that having a driverless car would keep them from having to do the work themselves. ,Counterclaim
"This will have a negative affect because they should be able to work under all condition of driving. Driverless cars can have negative aspect and positve aspect on the driving laws . In a negative way these cars cant function in certain areas and this can disrupt driving , it is also illgeal to even test computer driven cars in most states",Counterclaim
Many people believe that these autonomous cars are highly dangerous to the public.,Counterclaim
"Now, others will think the cars to be completely impractical in todays society,",Counterclaim
Their are many things that a car with no driver can lead people to think. Like it may lead people to think that maybe sitting in a car and not driving may get boring. ,Counterclaim
In contrast to that people may think that this might become a safety hazard. ,Counterclaim
However for some people the concept of driverless cars is scary. ,Counterclaim
"Many people will argue that Driverless Cars would be very helpful the todays busy and nonstop world,",Counterclaim
For now law is the major issue ,Counterclaim
I think that driverless cars could be very valuble in the future ,Counterclaim
Many of these driverless cars still require a form of human drivers to guide vehicles through special situations such as road blocks or work zones,Counterclaim
"This wouldn't be a so callled easy or quick prosses with getting these cars out on the road as soon as possile either, minor problems/faults with still occur.",Counterclaim
I do like the sound of all the cars that can drive itself. ,Counterclaim
If you were to buy a driver less car you would expect to relax during the car ride. ,Counterclaim
"However, these driverless cars still do obtain some faults. These faults are included in the article. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" This shows that drivers must retain some sort of awareness of what is going on around them. They cannot take naps or completely zone out, especially when approaching an accident or work zone.",Counterclaim
"Smart cars may not be ready, but smart roads are.",Counterclaim
Let's say cars would be able to drive without smart road.,Counterclaim
"Now some will ask ""how will you pay for such a large project?""",Counterclaim
"It sounds silly and far fetched at first, ",Counterclaim
Sadly these cars are not fully complete so some still need the assistance of humans when it comes to accidents or moving to avoid the work zones. ,Counterclaim
"These cars use rotating sensors, video cameras, automotive radar sensors, GPS receivers, and inertial motion sensors.

All these devices can add to the price of the car cuasing driverless cars to be more expensive.

Will people by these cars if the cost more or will they just sit. ",Counterclaim
The article mentions many of the new safety features of driverless cars.,Counterclaim
"There are still some trouble spots such as traffic jams, work zones, and accidents",Counterclaim
This actually probably could help people who are hurt/injured who can't drive get to places possibly ,Counterclaim
Some people will ignore that because they feel that they safe because of the driverless car.,Counterclaim
Some might say that driverless cars will take more jobs than it gives. These people say that taxi drivers and bus drivers will lose their jobs. ,Counterclaim
People might say that driverless cars end up making people lazier by allowing them to do little to nothing and still get where they want to go.,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, some people wouldn't lay their lives in the hands of a self driving car. ",Counterclaim
"However, these cars are not perfect by any means. They are sitll a work in progess meaning they will have some difficulties, or things that would hold them back.",Counterclaim
they claim that these driverless cars are more fual efficent ,Counterclaim
"The only problem with dreverless cars is that most law makers do not know if it is more safe with driverless cars or with humans drivers. Law makers know that the safety is best when they have alret drivers. Since lawmakers think that driverless cars are illegal in most states , expect for California , Nevada,Flordia , and the District of Columbia",Counterclaim
"Many people agree with the making of the car because ti will relieve alot of things and no ne will have to worry about driving 15 hours to another state becasue, the new and improved car will do all of that on its own. ",Counterclaim
 I know that accidents are gonna happen with a human driving a car or with a computer driving a car,Counterclaim
"It couldn't do harm, besides many lawsuits,",Counterclaim
But I'm not totally against it because it seems like they have the right idea. In the passage it states that the combination of the censors that the cars will need and the laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the diverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel!,Counterclaim
Some positive reasons for having driverless cars is that it would be easier and better for people to have them.,Counterclaim
There are some good things to having driverless cars though.,Counterclaim
Before they allow these cars out on the road first they have to get rid of some of the laws and regulations about driverless automobiles.,Counterclaim
"Some say that the driver would get bored waiting for ""their turn to drive"". Also others say it would not be fun sitting watching the car drive. ",Counterclaim
"Don't get my critism of the entire idea confused, I think it is a splendid idea.",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, there could be a couple positives to this.",Counterclaim
Some of my positives of the driverless cars are that if you late for work but didn't have time to eat breakfast then you can eat it in the car while the driverless car is driving or you could do your hair if you had to rush and all you could do is shower and get dressed. Or you have to talk on the phone for work or something because if you dont have a blutooth then you can't really drive with the phone in your hand and and you could get pulled over and get a ticked. ,Counterclaim
" Some states think the smart car may abstruct those laws such as California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia.",Counterclaim
Now I know that driverless cars would help people in many ways ,Counterclaim
"The only problem with the driverless car would be driver having to park on their own, as said in the passage.",Counterclaim
"Some people would call it laziness, ",Counterclaim
"Understandably, there are reasons why people are against the development for these smart cars. ",Counterclaim
"People, might often say,"" but we are becoming more advanced, why are you so against that?"".",Counterclaim
The positive sides to driverless cars is the people that text and drive really don't have to worry about wrecking because the car is doing everything for you and you really wouldn't have to watch the road.,Counterclaim
The other positive side to this driverless car is that there are antilock brakes which means that they are sensors and the story gives us evidence that it has been advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids and rollovers.,Counterclaim
The next positive thing that I think for the ddriverless cars is that it could help tremendously with the drunk driving people do.,Counterclaim
In the new cars drivers need to be aware as if anything goes wrond with the drive they are there to take over. why would anyone want a driveless car that still needs a driver? Wouldent it get boring waiting for your turn to drive?,Counterclaim
"Yes, it would be a success for our world of technology to make this happen.",Counterclaim
Most people would say the car would have a computer that would know the laws. ,Counterclaim
The cars wouldn't fix all of the problems that come along with cas accidents and problems,Counterclaim
One solution to the fact that a human operator must take over when facing roadwork is the idea of smart roads. Smart roads would use a cable to send radio signals to a receiver on the front of a car.,Counterclaim
" Yes I get that it could prevent traffic jams and take you the most fastest way to your destination according to traffic,",Counterclaim
"More materials might come out and make cars more safe than they already are,",Counterclaim
Even though they could be safer than a person driving,Counterclaim
"The author states ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This would make the passing of the law to allow self driving cars tricky",Counterclaim
whie what i said is true it is also a small issue that can be remedied within a couple years with new breakthroughs in how the new features operate to be much more reliable in an event when they're needed and also when updated traffic laws are put into place to accomodate the new smart cars,Counterclaim
"All of the ""driverless"" cars now arent fully driverless. ",Counterclaim
"Of course, if the technology was perfect, the cars could benefit in a lot of ways ",Counterclaim
"The other side of argument is that driverless cars are a good thing. According to paragraph one "",The car he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" That sentence shows that the people that are for driverless cars see change in fuel usage. The people for this car also say that the car has human like driving skills. There also claims of this car being driverless. They also claim that some people get bored behind the wheel of a older car. ",Counterclaim
"Yes, there are benifits to driverless cars",Counterclaim
Using the heads-up system is a good idea,Counterclaim
Some people may argue that these cars bring a negative aspect. They worry that these cars' technolgies could fail and they only feel secure when the car is driven with a human driver in control at all times. They also reason that sensors are nothing new.,Counterclaim
You guys may think this car is amazing,Counterclaim
"Even though I am against this, I still reconginze that there could be positives to this.",Counterclaim
People may say that even today with people driving cars that there can be glitches in cars.,Counterclaim
"One argument a person could use is that the cars would have more knowledge about driving than an actual person would, which could be helpful in reducing car accidents. People drive wrecklessly all the time. Which yes, this is true ",Counterclaim
"Yes, it is cool and fun to have",Counterclaim
"For people who are still worried that the cars will be unsafe because a computer can't decide what a human can and can't perform complex actions,",Counterclaim
"There are facts that prove that selfdriven cars are not a bad idea, and people have been working on imorving them for years. ",Counterclaim
"Now, the driverless cars sound easy to work. People can just lay back and enjoy a peaceful ride ",Counterclaim
"Despite the issues of liability and dependency on technology, the development of new cars could potentially reduce safety risks associated with full human control over vehicles. Because ""the information from the sensors [of the driverless cars] can cause the car to apply brakes... allow a far better response and control than a human could manage,"" driverless cars may reduce potential for crashes of other incidents. Advanced sensor technology is indeed an asset to this new development ",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, driverless cars can be very convient,",Counterclaim
"Driverless cars do sound like a good idea, having them take the wheel for you and not have the hard tasks of revesing when you can not see behind you, parallel parking, and not worrying about the speed you are going when the car can do it for you. ",Counterclaim
"It is true that there will be a lot of benefits of having driverless cars in the future, utilizing this invention could mean less human error on the roads, having those cars to be used as public transportation could be really convenient since everyone will have access to a form of transportation especially those who do not have a car to begin with, ",Counterclaim
"The good thing is that if you were on along road trip and needed to take a rest you wouldn't have to pull of to the side of the road you could just keep going and the car would drive for you. I have to say I do agree witht the vehicles that assist you when you drive tough busy areas or work areas, that is fine ",Counterclaim
But on the other side being for the driverless cars there are a lot of very good things that can come from using the driverless cars. ,Counterclaim
" on the flip side of things, this may not help.",Counterclaim
People and companies say this would be a good investment and the best choice ever ,Counterclaim
Manufacturers say this will be a great acheievment i agree,Counterclaim
negatives ,Counterclaim
"If this is a big topic why hasnt our gonverment or anybody tried to invest in the idea of a driverless car. Well theres many things we have to consider. Who would be elgible , how much would it cost etc. In the back of my mind i would think would happen if this wass actually a thing and somebody was in the car and it ran off the road or something even worse would happen. What would happen to cab drivers would they lose their jobs ? So there are many factors that go into creating new things. In Paragraph 8 the first sentence reads "" Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver ? "" that question can be answered in a sence we would still need to be in the car but would we be controling the car or would we sit back and relax? Theres no problem with that but what happens when there is a car acciendent or a traffic stop infront of you will your car alert you on whats happing ? Will you need to take control of whats happing , basically how ssmart is your car ?",Counterclaim
The public will react in a way that this a bad idea and that it should be scapped,Counterclaim
Some may argue that driverless cars are better than human drivers. ,Counterclaim
"This is argued however, as it does state in the passage that advancements are being made. These advancements are predicted to creat a real driverless car by 2020. ",Counterclaim
" This can be argued, however, as supporters of this say that cars that need drivers would never be removed, and races will stay the same as it always has been. They allso can argue, from the passage, that,""Some manufacturers hope to do that (make driverless cars fun) by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" ",Counterclaim
There are still certain states that have laws that state that the car would only be safe IF there is a human driver in control of the wheel.,Counterclaim
"the only thing i think would be cool about it is if i am tired and im driving and i need to go to sleep and the car could drive on its own,",Counterclaim
"When you have control you feel safer, but this can also be a con. When you hear ""Driverless cars""

you think that you won't have to do anything when thats not the case, yet.",Counterclaim
There is a positive side to having driverless cars ,Counterclaim
"Some people may think that driverless cars would not be safe at all, and may cause more wrecks.",Counterclaim
"Although, it seems with every advance in technology, there is often a down side.",Counterclaim
Even though driverless cars can possibaly be good for the economy because they use half the fuel of today's taxis,Counterclaim
Even though these cars can possabily be safer for the public when it comes to drunk drivers ,Counterclaim
But again on my other side i'm thinking that people will take adavantage of this opportunity and will be on their phones or with their buddies in the car doing something they should'nt be doing. ,Counterclaim
Some people are saying whatever if i dont trust it ,Counterclaim
"Owning a driverless car could be extremly helpful. Driverless cars will still require a driver who is paying attention to the road at all times. These cars could helpful, of course you would still have to pay attention to the road but you could relax more and not be as stressed out as you would when you are driving.",Counterclaim
Some thing make me think that driveless cars are good,Counterclaim
that it will cause less wrecks,Counterclaim
You may be asking yourselves why anyone would want a driverless car that still needs a driver. No one likes to be completely helpless or bored and waiting to take their turn. ,Counterclaim
"The positive ideas stated in the paragragh are less fuel, safer, and you dont have to completely manualy drive a car yourself. In this article one of the many reasons why driveless cars would be safer is they can steer, accelerate, brake themselves, and they notifie the driver when the need to take over the controls for certain situations. Safety is a be concern to modern drivers, the article states manufactures want to bring entertainment to the cars while you enjoy your trip. These displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature. ",Counterclaim
Yes the fuel is half as much as it use to be,Counterclaim
Some people may believe that the development of driverless cars is a positive thing since our technology is capable to making driveless cars that are safe (to a certain extend) and have a ability to mimic human skills,Counterclaim
Driveless cars do has its fault too.,Counterclaim
"There are some that believe with have a long way to go with the law until we see self driving cars. Paragraph nine states that ""Most drtiving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."". They believe that without an alert driver at the wheel, the car endangers everyone around it. ",Counterclaim
It is cool that they drive themselves ,Counterclaim
"I understand the idea, and to me it sounds cool ",Counterclaim
These things might help ,Counterclaim
"However it could be a good idea to always add safety things to the car, ",Counterclaim
 With the thought and hope to succeed in the completely driverless car the goal would be to reduce the amount of car crashes and provide safer transportation. ,Counterclaim
"The driverless car could reduce the cost needed for vehicles and their needed repairs, they would be mostly robotic, and could reduce gas and gas prices causing chemicals in the air to be reduced. ",Counterclaim
"Although in many cases this may not be true,",Counterclaim
"But the con about that, is that the driver might have issues trusting the driverless car",Counterclaim
Another con will be how might the driverless car react upon other driverless cars ,Counterclaim
"Although driverless cars will not fully be completly driverless. You still can have the ability to take over the driving,",Counterclaim
Critics of the concept believe computer-ran vehicles can reach nowhere near the skill or safety of human-ran vehicles. ,Counterclaim
What would be the point of a driverless car? Reduce the number of drunk drivers on the road maybe. Or give people who can't drive the transportation they need without public transports. This would all be great! ,Counterclaim

"Some people might see a driverless car as a loss of freedom or a loss of control,",Counterclaim
Another argument not stated in the document was the issue of misuse of the self driving car. A major trajedy in our society is that people would possibly try to use its autonomous abilities to achieve a terrorist goal. ,Counterclaim
"But, these cars could be useful to get a good nap in, or rest so someone isn't tired and driving. They could also help out with drunk driving. ",Counterclaim
"Many say that driverless technology is not safe. Some also think that becuse they technology is likely to fail, whoes faut will it be if someone is injured",Counterclaim

"
Before we I go into the mees that is driverless cars, what I can say is a great system that was added was a combination of still having the driver in the drivers seat with his hands on the wheel, and being able to perfect a error thats happen in the progam of the car. Becuase at the end of the day, technogoly was made by fulad people and will make tech fulad no matter what. ",Counterclaim

No more drivers would be needed, and robots are more coordinated so driving would become a lot safer. ",Counterclaim
Some people may argue that the driverless cars are not safe because they still need some help from the passenger for emercency situations ,Counterclaim
Most people think that driverless cars are dangerous,Counterclaim
Some may say that is a plus because they don't have do pay twenty dollars to put in gas every week ,Counterclaim
However this does raise some intersting problems especially for the manufacturer and the legal system,Counterclaim
"Yet the car would still be able to control itself so that the driver is allowed to do many other things. In the case , to say, that the driver has been drinking that night and is in no way in shape to drive for a certain amount to drive. The car can ""handle driving functions of at speeds of 25 mph... they can steer, accelerate, and even break themselves"" (paragraph 7). This just shows the car's many capabilities of what it can do. Also the car has a feature that can allow the driver to turn of the autopilot and allow the driver to take control in case it is needed. Since ""the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern"" (paragrph 8). This goes to prove that drivwers are safer in this type of car.

 a desaventage is that if the sensors don't work what would happen?. ,Counterclaim

Cars like driverless cars are not perfect and they are not 100 percent safe, these cars can be really expensive too and not everyone would buy them. ",Counterclaim
"Of course,according to paragraph seven,Google didnt extend the possibilites of having a successful driverless car. They just made the driverless car not really driverless.

In someway it sounds helpful but in another way it just sounds as if the driver is still driving no matter what.",Counterclaim
The idea of driverless cars is neat ,Counterclaim
The sensors in cars are more advanced today than they have ever been,Counterclaim
On the other hand though if this idea was a possibility with more safety with no driver needed at all then any company that perfects the production first will be very rich indeed.,Counterclaim

"Most lawmakers are against the use of driverless cars on public roads because of a safety concerns,",Counterclaim

There are some negatives though! I mean the car can drive its self theres negatives in that its self. What if you get bored and fall alseep you might wrec and or hold up traffic. The senors may mess up and cause an accident. Then whos fault would that be? ",Counterclaim

"Yet, the word 'rarely' still sticks, and not many can just simply deny that it is not there. The rest of the statment in paragraph 16 continues onto lines 4-6, ""[;however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" So in simple terms, you can get the electoral vote which can put you ahead, but you won't win with just that under your belt.

As for others they are completly against popular votes and think that electoral votes are more safe and calming for many reasons.,Counterclaim

It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.,Counterclaim
people say that the electoral voting system may turn alot of potential voters away from voting for a new president since the electoral voting has been tight on alot of people who don't like to use that way then they want it as a direct election and to abolish the electoral college! ,Counterclaim

Others may say that the electoral college works and that it should be here to stay. Many opinions are to be heard. ,Counterclaim
A reason that people may want the electoral college is stay in place would be that the electors would do all the dirty work for them and they won't have to cast two votes the year that the new president will be chosen.

What's wrong with electoral college? ,Counterclaim
Now Electoral College may be unfair and outdated but some people still support it and like the ways of it. ,Counterclaim
The Electoral College usually balences the voting considering large states gets more attention from presidential campaigns then a small state would,Counterclaim
There is also some wrong with the electoral college. It does have problems as most things do. ,Counterclaim
I understand that some feel it's ok if the the voting is left mainly to toss up states because they seem to be the the people who are more thoughtful about the lection. ,Counterclaim

. There are many reasons why elcetoral college should be abolished. But In the defence of The electoral votes this can be the tie breaker. If the candidates come to a tie in popular votes The electoral votes will establish which one recieved the most electoral college votes.,Counterclaim
Now there are a few bad things about the Electoral College. Like one is the fact that a tie is posible. ,Counterclaim
"Another is that it's out dated. Lastly each party picks a slate of electors to vote for the party's nominee and it's posible that trust can be betrayed, but that's rare.",Counterclaim

"To wrap everything up, the single best arguement agains tht eelectoral college is what we might call a disaster factor.",Counterclaim

Although the outcome of a tie is unlikely (Posner),Counterclaim
For me i believe that those who want to remove the electoral college possibly look at is as it being unfair.,Counterclaim

The eletorial college is good it has our vote in it too ,Counterclaim
Some believe that their vote won't make a differnece.,Counterclaim
You could argue that it takes time out of the election or that it helps Amricans ,Counterclaim
but having electoral colleges will avoid run-off elections. Run-off elections are when no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast.,Counterclaim
Apparently people would rather have wanted a direct election to the kind we have now ,Counterclaim
"When you use the Electoral College your not just voting for a president your voting for a slate also. Which could also lead to the disaster factor , when everyone has an arguement against the electoral college ",Counterclaim
The Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner-takes-all system in each state ,Counterclaim
What if there was no majority vote or if there were to be a tie?,Counterclaim
Many may argue that some voters aren't well educated and don't have the knowledge need to make the right choice and that they might get confused and make the wrong choice.,Counterclaim

"It may be old,",Counterclaim
Some people dont like tovote in fear of their party not winning due to its unpopularity.,Counterclaim
Even though the Electoral College would keep somewhat of a balance to voting ,Counterclaim
Also another reason would be that the people only vote for a slate whether it be democratic or republic people in the slate can just change there mind and pick a differnt side. I would understand this system before our time,Counterclaim
"However even in the midst of all that wrong with Electorial System people have found right in it. For instance source 3 says that ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed).""",Counterclaim

Some of the counter arguements for electoral colleges is that the bigger states get more recignition,Counterclaim
"At the most basic level, however, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. ",Counterclaim

"their is some upsides to the electoral college system.

And in the bigger states the electoral college therew are more electoral votes due to the amount of people in the states and in this case more votes equal higher of a chance of the person you picked to become president. ,Counterclaim
", and as some would argue, this prevents candidates from visiting smaller states, all becuase they want the most votes,",Counterclaim
On the other side of the argument are those who want to abolish the Electoral College. They pose many reasons for why they want this such as what is often called the disaster factor.,Counterclaim
"The argument that the electoral college discourages voters of the minority party to vote is a valid criticism, but it is a problem that can be solved without the loss of the electoral college ",Counterclaim
"In source 2, Bradford Plumer expressed dissatisfaction with the way political campaigns involving the electoral college focus on swing states rather than allowing equal debate in all states, but that does not make for a less desirable outcome.",Counterclaim

"People may not like it because the people who are voting for a president really are not voting for the  president, their voting for the electors to vote for the president. Which makes sense ",Counterclaim

"Proponents of the Electoral College would gasp in horror at this suggestion, arguing that their systematic method is virtually foolproof ",Counterclaim
"Furthermore, advocates of the Electoral College make a major fallacy when they claim that voters in swing states are more informed on election information, therefore it's good that the electoral system causes candidates to only focus on them.",Counterclaim

Yes some things are unfair for example : voters don't vote for the president directly and the fact that voters can't always control whom their electors vote for  ,Counterclaim
Yes the electoral college has a few negative things,Counterclaim
Most people don't really care that their votes go to deciding who is on the electoral college ,Counterclaim
"""The people in upper state are most likely to pay attention to the campain"", says the article. Why would they do that?. Because they would have resived the most information and attention there is from the candidates. They are likely to be the most thoughtful people when its comes down to voting.

But i also see that from where you stand the Electral Collage may be just a waste of money and in some peoples eyes it is.,Counterclaim

A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes, 538, is an even number, but its highly unlikely.

Another of the five, ""Everyone's Prseident"",No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win.

"It is true there have been faults.  Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO have all antagonized the Electoral College.  One reason is that electorals do not have to vote for whom ever they chose in the beginning. ",Counterclaim
"But the true problem is the word of the people.  We have so many speakers for us, but they don't always say the right things that we want. ",Counterclaim
Initially the Electoral College voting method sounded like a great idea,Counterclaim
While the electoral college holds many faults I'm sure in the past there have also been  pop-ups of downsides to the popular voting method also. ,Counterclaim
"There are still a lot of down falls to this method of the electoral college though. One of these issues is ""at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voter"" ",Counterclaim
 Another issue with this method is that the person thats running for president might get the popularity vote but still not win.,Counterclaim
Some people don't really agree with the electoral college process because they belive that if you vote you are voting for electors of your state that eventually vote for you at the end ,Counterclaim
"The electoral college is widely looked at as a person, a non-democratic way of selecting a U.S president that is going to be overruled by saying the canidate who recieves the most popular votes is the winner ",Counterclaim
It has come to my attention that there has been a majority of people who do not agree with the Electoral College and wish for it to be abolished.,Counterclaim
"It also mentions that  if a tie were to happen in the electoral votes, the election would be thrown out of the House of Representatives and the state delegations vote for the president. ",Counterclaim
"Some people may disagree on that. Maybe other people want just states to vote, and get it over with. It would be an easier way to choose the president, ",Counterclaim
"it would be kind of difficult to count all those votes, ",Counterclaim
"The Electoral College in the other hand, allows votes from states to be made. It is an easier method to get the states to vote for the president, and it takes less time. ",Counterclaim
"Others may have different opinions, maybe they like the Electoral College better than the popular vote.",Counterclaim
The Electoral College also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives majority of the votes cast. ,Counterclaim
There are some drawbacks like it is outdated and irrational ,Counterclaim
"Although I must state that the Electoral College does help avoid run-off elections according to source 3 by Richard A. Posner, parahgraph 22.",Counterclaim
"There are disadvantages to like voters dont vote for the president, but for a slate electors, who votes for the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters ",Counterclaim
"Electoral College systems may be in favor in many ways like the winner takes all method, or each candidate running for president having their own electors.",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, there are very few reasons that are pointing towards the electoral college being a good idea. For example,

The electoral college has a even number of votes which make it easier to have a more predictable outcome of who might win the election ",Counterclaim
"The electoral college also comes along with the ""Winner-take-all"" method in which the awarding electoral votes induces the candidates running for the presidency. ",Counterclaim
"There is one turn that can happen at any given election and is most-likely our biggest worry because of such an open chance. Though it is said that there is highly rare chance in which a day would come in the election that a defiance might occur, ",Counterclaim
Many people against the Electoral College argue that the system is not acceptable because of the possibility of a tie due to the even number of electoral votes. ,Counterclaim
Their are alot of great reasonings about electoral college but there are some bad reasonings to ,Counterclaim
Though our founding fathers decided that we needed a system to decide the President instead of letting the people decide,Counterclaim

People want to abolish the Electoral College due to citizens not being able to vote for the president ,Counterclaim

yes this system is we the people actually voting for our state elctors,Counterclaim
 They say the electoral college restpres some of the weight in the political balance. ,Counterclaim
"But Electoral College are not all bad. Electoral College consist of 538 electors, a majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the president(The Office of the Federal Register)..

Electoral College by stating that the representatives who are runnning for president are choosing trusted people who knows that they will make the right decision and also that if there was to ever be a dispute over the

Electoral College",Counterclaim
"However source three has made some pretty good points on the electoral college. Saying that '' if there was no electoral college there would be no winner-take-all system.'' this would a terrible problem for the canidates and the voters, and would ruin the whole election.",Counterclaim
I understand the Electoral College process has been in place for a very long time,Counterclaim
if you elect your president by the popular then the required number will be higher and possible wont have a president because they will never finsh counting the votes. ,Counterclaim
one reason to pick electors is because its less people to keep count of. Having these electors is another step in the voting procces but it keeps things going easier.,Counterclaim

 the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance,Counterclaim
"Many people do not favor this method of election, and argue that:""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""",Counterclaim

The electoral college may possess many past mistakes and close runs,Counterclaim

"Well I see that the Electoral College can be unfair but it is also fair in it's own right. Because of the fiasco in the year of two thousand about the abolishment of the Electoral College, it has left a scare in our nation about the government, ",Counterclaim
"It may be unfair, because the majority of the people may have chosen one person while the electors may choose the other. Then when they add it together it is there vote that counts more than the peoples.",Counterclaim
Some of you may believe that this saves time ,Counterclaim
the congress has some erros,Counterclaim
"In the other hand,voting by Electoral College  benefited us .",Counterclaim
Even though the college restores the politicaql balance between large and small states and has it's good sides to it ,Counterclaim
"In the eyes of some, one in particular being Richard A. Posner, Electoral College may be good for a few reasons, those reasons being, Certainty of Outcome, Everyone's President, Swing States, Big States, and avoid Run-Off Elections",Counterclaim

Even though we can not control who the electors vote for  ,Counterclaim

Some good reasons on why to keep it is becuse it can avoid run off election the electoral collage requirws candidate to have trans regional appeal.,Counterclaim
"The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in the modern sense...it is electors who elect the president,not the people ",Counterclaim
"On the the hand, sometimes the canidate with the most popular votes can be the worst if he became president.",Counterclaim
Also some people might argue that the Electoral college might turn down potential voters.,Counterclaim
"Others may argue that this is how our nation should be, just as it is right now,",Counterclaim
"There are some people who are going to say that the electoral colledge is a good way to elect our president and I understand that.

The electoral colledge might be a good thing because it consists of qualified government hired officials instead of everyday commoners like us. ",Counterclaim
"One might claim that because the amount of electoral votes for a state is based of the population, it is fair.",Counterclaim
However it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.,Counterclaim
 Although that is very rarely ever betrayed- as noted by my recent research,Counterclaim
"I understand the need for the Electoral College, when it comes to some decisions. Like avoiding a national catastrophe when it comes to the nuber of swing-votes.",Counterclaim

"the Electoral College may make voters feel like they have no input on the election,",Counterclaim
People claim that the most involved voters should be able to decide the elections.,Counterclaim
Well what is bad about the Electoral College is that it is unfair for the voters that is doing the voting. ,Counterclaim
Everyone has that one good argument. Everyone calls the Electoral College a disaster factor.,Counterclaim
"I understand the good in the electoral college though.It helps keep states from tieing ,and causing chaos.",Counterclaim
One reason some people chose to have the electoral vote is because the president is winning everything. And the electoral college requires a presidental candidate.,Counterclaim
There is a few reasons that opposing opioninated people use to justify wanting to keep the Electoral College around ,Counterclaim
I do not only think that the Electoral College is just something terrible but it also has some pros to it also. I believe it is good to also have an opinion of people who are some way apart of the U.S. government to vote to see a different point of view. The person who has the majority of popular votes might not always be the right president for the current place and time the country. It is also good that smaller populated states mean more than larger populated states. ,Counterclaim
The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. ,Counterclaim
then theres also the situation that we can vote for our elector but we may often get confused and rhem choos e the wrong one ,Counterclaim
"Yes, The electoral college might be voting for what they think is best for us ",Counterclaim
"""The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast."" (Posner, paragraph 22)",Counterclaim
the passage did say the electoral college is unfair and outdadated,Counterclaim
"The electoral college does have some advantages. Like swing states,

or avoiding run-off elections",Counterclaim
"No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", Source 2, argues that a term called 'disaster factor', or the possibility of immenent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished ",Counterclaim
the voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. ,Counterclaim
even though there are many many disavantages and mistakes about the Electoral College there are a few advantages. Like it takes less time for the congress to vote.,Counterclaim
I admit the congress does know alot,Counterclaim
Revising the electoral college system may seem like a bad idea,Counterclaim
Only the 2000 election was disputed over. Al Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet Bush was elected to presidency because of the Electoral College,Counterclaim
 many people are against it they believe there vocies aren't  being heard ,Counterclaim
Some may think that the Electoral college is a better choice because their is different benifits about the electors voting instead of americas people.,Counterclaim
"Although there was one ""fiasco"" in 2000, as Bradford Plumer calls it in Source 2,",Counterclaim
It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state ,Counterclaim
"Now im going to tell you something bad about keeping the Electoral College. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.",Counterclaim
Did you know the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor ,Counterclaim
Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.,Counterclaim
"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters ",Counterclaim
"Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. ",Counterclaim
Some people say that the Electoral College restores some of the weight in political balance that large states (by population) lose by the virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. ,Counterclaim
"Admittably, there have been a few blips in the system ",Counterclaim
"Well so there's people or citizen that want the electoral college to keep going but some don't reason to that is in the story this is what it says, ""The electoral college  is unfair, outdated, and irrational.",Counterclaim
" But in that case I would like to not want the electoral collge to keep going mostly due to unfairness, outdated,irrational. ",Counterclaim
Since the electoral college is still working the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-- ,Counterclaim
"In other opinions around the world the Electoral Colege is widely regarded as an ""anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.""",Counterclaim
I have to admit myself that the Electoral College  is unfair to some potenial voters as well.,Counterclaim
"However, on the other side the people that want to keep it are the ones that look at the few good things not the bad things. Of those helpful things that comes with the electoral college is it majorly decreases the chance of a run-off election in which no cannidate receives a majority of the votes cast.",Counterclaim
The Electoral college also puts out a certainty of outcome because there is less likely to be a dispute over the outcome in a popular vote then a dispute over an Electoral College vote. ,Counterclaim
Some might say that they dont know where their votes are going to,Counterclaim
"Many people stand by the Electoral College as the best course of action. They argue that the certainty of the winner is better, a candidate can't win the election due to regional favor, and this system unsures that there will still be a clear winner even when each candidate recieves the same percentage of votes. ",Counterclaim
" However, it fails to do just that ",Counterclaim
but sometimes its not the most cause if bigger states with more powerful people vote for a diffrent president and the one president has the most votes but if the other one has the more votes from bigger states and cities like california then he gets the popular vote. ,Counterclaim
The single best argument against the electoral college is what researchers call the disaster factor.,Counterclaim
"Yes, I know that there are people that think that it is ok for the Electoral College to do all the voting.",Counterclaim
Many people argue that electoral college method of selectingthe president may lose potential voters knowing there vote will have no effect.,Counterclaim
"It makes sense for the canidates to see ""swing states""-the states that are more divided, and whose electoral votes are not guaranteed one way or another. ",Counterclaim
I understand having electors reduces the chance of having a president who can't carry our state,Counterclaim
"Yes, also true the electoral vote keeps other parties who are not sufficient enough to run the country ",Counterclaim
"In the Electoral College's defense, the Electoral College, as illustrated by Richard A. Posner, ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution,"" meaning that a presidential candidate will give more attention to a larger state than a smaller state.",Counterclaim
"However, Some of our best presidents have gotten picked by the Electoral College there is no doubt in that.",Counterclaim
Other people think that we should change the Electoral College to the election by popular vote.,Counterclaim
"And i aslo heard that if an electoral tie seems unlikley, consider this",Counterclaim
"Now, I know what you're thinking, ""Why would we change this system? It is already established and has worked for many years."" ",Counterclaim
I know that the Electoral College process has some issues like the voters not being able to know for sure who their slate of electors are going to vote for. In some very rare cases the electors do not vote for the candidant you want them to vote for.,Counterclaim
"Another issue is that sometimes in a close election, the popular vote winner could lose the presidency.",Counterclaim
"The Electoral College is a widely regarded as an anachrosim, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruledbydeclaring the candidate who receives the most popular vote the winner. Not only that, but a disputeover the outcome of an Elecotral College voteis possible-it happened in 2000-",Counterclaim
"People do actually believe in this system of voting though, hard to believe, I know, but Richard A. Posner's ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" gives us a pretty good reason of why they should ",Counterclaim
"An electoral tie seems unlikely think of this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976 a tie would have occured if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted diffrently. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe. ",Counterclaim
"""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor"".People are worried that the governmetn will choose for them. ",Counterclaim
The elctoral college was evective in the past because we did not have the technologe to count all the votes from each state ,Counterclaim
"Certainly, the Electoral College has some flukes. ",Counterclaim
The only time an electoral college is necessary is if the presidential race is at a tie with the number of votes and its all on the electoral college ,Counterclaim
"Now, of course, the other view has to be adressed. As stated in the second article, ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning... During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This quote shows that the canidates might not go to a state they know they have no chance in winning.",Counterclaim
The opposition even admits that the President may not be who the nation wants as their leader ,Counterclaim
I can understand an opinion that thinks the Electoral College is great and I'm sure it's a little less complicated and such,Counterclaim
"The election by popular vote is saying that the electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational ",Counterclaim
Yes people may say that without the electoral college favoritism may appear in certain states and places.,Counterclaim
"Most people think that we should get rid of the electoral college,its clearly a state of opinion. ",Counterclaim

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President

, by Ricard A. Posner, says ""The Electoral College is a widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring a canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" It does offer support that maybe our country needs. Maybe we do need help in choosing who our president should be. The Electoral College gives us us a more official point of view on which president should be elected. ",Counterclaim
your saying how is that fair if just because you a bigger state you get more represenatives?,Counterclaim
Popular vote is kind of fair in a way because we can all vote like independent citizens. ,Counterclaim
don't get me wrong people's votes do influence electors in deciding which president won their votes.,Counterclaim
It is possible for the candidate with the most electoral votes not win the national vote. ,Counterclaim
 The electoral college has been around for a long time. Many people think it is an out dated way for electing a presidnet and Vice president ,Counterclaim
Many argue that the electoral college method of slecting a president may turn off potenial voters. ,Counterclaim
This may not seem like much of a problem ,Counterclaim
Those in favor of the electoral college argue that because candidates will focus on swing states in order to win voters in those states will pay closer attention to the election and make a more educated decision (Richard A. Posner 20).,Counterclaim
If people want to change the election for popular votes  is basically your generallly chosen by the candidates politcal party...and what their responsibilities are,Counterclaim
"Now, if people want to change the election by popular voting is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your states electors when you vote for presidents because when you vote for your candidates you are actually voting for your candidates electors.",Counterclaim
"Perhaps in ''Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president'' by Richard A. Posner, an electoral college would be good to have because of run off and big states and so forth. ",Counterclaim
Many people thing of electoral college as torchure or even the wrong way to vote.,Counterclaim
"Now, in the defese of the electoral college it does help situations in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast which can be very helpful",Counterclaim
Most Americans that are angered and upset when they realize their vote doesn't have as much say as they though are usually the ones who fight to abolish the Electoral College ,Counterclaim
While the winner-takes-all system is unfair to those who do not agree with the side the state chose overall ,Counterclaim
"But electoral votes blance out the states say in the vote, if a big state all votes against a small state the big one will win the electoral college balances that ",Counterclaim
"Of course, there are many valid points why the Electoral College is still a good system and should be kept",Counterclaim
"Although many people despise the Electoral College, there are also some good reasons to keep this method of choosing the President stated in Source 3. Some of the reasons are certainty of outcome, no trans-regional appeal, and avoiding run-off elections. These are just three reasons despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. ",Counterclaim
It dooes work to keep complications from arising in our voting procedures none the less. ,Counterclaim
And I will admit regional preferance is also a huge problem.,Counterclaim
On the other hand having the electoral votes may not be such a bad thing. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College also restore some of the weight in the political balance that large states.,Counterclaim
"The Electoral College has its good part which states in source #3, paragraph 22 "" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep your despised method of choosing president"" "" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast."" It shows how it helps with the majority votes.",Counterclaim
"It's good how the Electoral College has steps and takes time to go through the motions of how many votes and who does the electors vote for and all, ",Counterclaim
"The electoral college method may not seem democratic in a modern sense, ",Counterclaim
 Many Americans believe that this method is crucial because it's certainty of outcomes and the way it avoids run-off elections. ,Counterclaim
Some people might say we should keep the electoral college because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee so nothing can happen ,Counterclaim
"why the Electoral College should not be changed in any way, due to the ""...Certainty of Outcome...Everyone's President...Swing States...Big States... Avoid Run-Off Elections..."" ",Counterclaim
"On the counterclaim that it could be a tie, ",Counterclaim
"""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" ",Counterclaim
There is another group that thinks that the voteing procesess should stay the same ,Counterclaim
"While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states ",Counterclaim
"Some people say that the Electoral College is a good thing. It allows a certainty of outcome and is a fair, reasonable way to vote for a president.",Counterclaim
Another opposing view is that we should keep the electoral college for a couple of reasons to avoid run off elections,Counterclaim
Another debate  is that presidents would go after states with bigger populations,Counterclaim
The electoral college is widely known as an anachronism.,Counterclaim
"But it just can't be perfect there also some deffects like when under the eloctoral colleges you don't voto for the president, but for a slate of electors which they vote for the president if the got the most votes. ",Counterclaim
There is also an oposite side to this and it is the people who don't want to vote under electoral colleges.,Counterclaim
Some people may argue that we should keep it,Counterclaim
Others may argue that the Electoral college helps break a tie,Counterclaim
"In Source 3, Posner states that when there is an unclear plurality in the results of an election, the Electoral College makes it much simpler and more efficient by reducing the number of voters, eliminating the inconvenience factor.",Counterclaim
" Yes, It is possible that the outcome of the popular vote that the people have chosen is not in agreement",Counterclaim
 their has been times In which it that is not always the case ,Counterclaim
When these electors vote they are not well regulated ,Counterclaim
Now there is only one con to the Electoral College and that is that it may turn off people from voting because they believe that their vote out of everybody who votes isnt enough to do a difference so they dont even vote.,Counterclaim
Some people say that a canidate may try to appeal to a set of voters but in the end just use them in order to win the presidency.,Counterclaim
"The Electoral college is claimed to keep the voting system in line and prevent major mess, however this is not truly the case.",Counterclaim
"In the sense that some might argue that the Electoral College is perfect the way it is, ",Counterclaim
Sure it helps with Wyoming and the proportionality of their representatives ,Counterclaim
 Its was created to prevent any regional favorite in voting and for a long time it has been successful in doing so. ,Counterclaim
"The only thing against the electoral college, is what we might call the

Disaster Factor. ",Counterclaim
"Americans throughout the country believe that the Electoral College isn't fair and believe that they deserve a more direct voting syste to the president, other than voting for electors.",Counterclaim
"As said in the previous statement, Americans that want the Electoral College gone are lurking for more power when it comes to rules. ",Counterclaim
"Moving on, almost 60 percent of all American voters stated that they would rather have a direct voting system, putting aside the Electoral College.",Counterclaim
"Furthermore, the Electoral college may have a few benefits as it states in source 3. Fore example, it says ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" meaning that barely anyone would vote in the state.",Counterclaim
"To begin with, the Electoral College, in a sense, is not democratic, as seen in modern times",Counterclaim
"However, others can argue against the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always,""",Counterclaim
Opposers might say that our votes don't even matter due to the fact that the popular vote doesn't directly determine our nation's President. ,Counterclaim
"For example, in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer whines about how, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters,"" going on to say that, ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states,"" (Plumer 13).",Counterclaim
"Even though the Electoral College is amazing and revolutionised The United States, ""under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of selectors, who in turn could elect the President."" (paragragh 10)",Counterclaim
"Sometimes the Electoral College make a well political decision and could problaby help more the government, while the people were just selecting someone that was going to destroy the government",Counterclaim
" In the other hand the popular vote would get really tie and one of the person that is running for president would ask for a recount of the vote, so it would take longer to select the president.",Counterclaim
"Admmitedely, the winner take all system is a fair way of deviding the votes. ",Counterclaim
It can be argued that the prsident may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state. ,Counterclaim
There's a few reasons for retainig the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: the first one is that a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible,Counterclaim
the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal ,Counterclaim
The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in wich no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.,Counterclaim
"One may say that Electoral College is the best system for voting,",Counterclaim
"While it does allow them to vote for a slate of electors who then elect the president usually based off of the popular vote,",Counterclaim
So while you might think your individual vote makes a difference ,Counterclaim
Some might say that the Electoral College is an easier method to count the votes,Counterclaim
Not everything about the Electoral college is bad.,Counterclaim
it is true that public voters dont directly vote for the president and sometimes the electores may not vote for the right person. ,Counterclaim
Yes a puplic vote does not go direcly to helping a person win,Counterclaim
Some argue that a few votes can not do a lot and that the Electoral College is a far more organized way to conduct the voting.,Counterclaim
Another thing about the voting process i think i shoul'd talk about is some of the possible problems you can come across after this change in the voting process. ,Counterclaim
i know most peole or adults that really vote and our into politics would say otherwise,Counterclaim
"One such concern would be if a candidate won the popular vote but did not win the presidency as shown here "" This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency.""(source 2). This does seem rather odd considering the seemigly non-democratic nature of this process ",Counterclaim
"While some might then say that the system is still very biased,",Counterclaim
While this is very rare it can also lead to pressure for a run-off election which would make the election process extremely difficult.,Counterclaim
"If you still do not believe that the Electoral College is truly ""fair"", ",Counterclaim
"There are some good things about the Electoral College, though. I admit the Electoral College would be good when the people's votes are close or maybe even tie,",Counterclaim
"I think it's also smart that when you vote for who you want to be president, you also vote for their electors. ",Counterclaim
This neglect isn't the fault of the candidates though. ,Counterclaim
The counterclaim for my argument may suggest that the certainty of outcome and the expulsion of run-off elections is enough to substantiate the electoral college.,Counterclaim
They don't want election by popular vote cause they are afraid that a tie will happen because an election usually stops around 538,Counterclaim
Although it has some negatives there is way more positive effects. Im not saying using the electoral college way is bad because they do have some good cause;,Counterclaim
"majority rules,",Counterclaim
"""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" as stated on line 22 of In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. ",Counterclaim
You also must know that the system has its faults ,Counterclaim
"Even thought this might be a really improved method on picking our president, it still has faults ",Counterclaim
" On the other hand, it has not changed at all only to stay unfair towards the entire country and possibly cause a catasrophe. ",Counterclaim
The argument though is that with the Electoral College the votes which are dominant have a better chance of the two nominees not having the same amount of votes rather than if it was relied on by the popularity votes ,Counterclaim
The electoral vote has made bad decisions yet good decisions throughout the hundreds of years its been around and the main reasin for electoral votes are to keep the candidates running not have the same number of votes so that they won't have to have another election and voting cast. ,Counterclaim
Some people would argue that the Electoral college should be kept because it ensures the certaintity of the outcome ( source 3 paragoh 18).,Counterclaim
"In another article ""In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", they argue as to why we should keep the electoral college. The author of the article, Richard A. Posner, said that there is a certainity of outcome, that the winning canidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. ",Counterclaim
"reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President is the Certainy of Outcomes. In 2000, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote was possible ",Counterclaim
"Yes, it might be unfair for thoses who are wanting to be electors and can't because the person they are running for lost ",Counterclaim
Yet some people still argue that the electoral college isnt flawed and fairly represents everyone. ,Counterclaim
"Some of the ludicrous claimes made by supporters of the electral college are that you avoid run off elections, the so called ""certainty of outcome"", and many other outlandish claims ",Counterclaim
"Many people disagree with my opinion and there are a few reasons why, that even I support. From the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president,"" by Richard A. Posner, he states that the outcome is certain when applying electoral college to a vote, while a dispute can be more likely to occur using the popular vote method. ",Counterclaim
People still continue to argue about the Electoral College method of selecting the president. that it may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state Democrats. ,Counterclaim
"On one hand, yes. The Electoral College does seem to work. ",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, Electors not sticking to what they said rarely happens (Or so we are told). As well as that, the Electoral College seems to work well and has a certainty of the outcome and avoids ""Run-off"" elections. ",Counterclaim
The single best arguement againt the electoral college is what we might call the disaster facter.,Counterclaim
"Granted, that the electoral college does give a certainty of outcome and that no region on its own can vote for a president, it does give an equal chance for everybody to have their mostly preffered president ",Counterclaim
"Although the Electoral College is the method in which we select our president, it may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state ",Counterclaim
"Sure, The electoral college has some perks like a certainty of outcome",Counterclaim
Some counterclaims that state that we should keep the electoral college enacted state that there will always be swing states. ,Counterclaim
"To begin, by keeping the electoral college we could avoid run off elections.  This would help our governmental system",Counterclaim
"However, people say that the electoral college gives the certainty of an out come. It states in Source 3, "" A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.""",Counterclaim
You many think your vote doesn't count,Counterclaim
" As many of you guys know many people vote, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. They all say that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational ",Counterclaim
"Even though the Electoral Collage seems like th root of all evil, there are a few upsides ",Counterclaim
 other people are saying how good the electoral college is ,Counterclaim
A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 200,Counterclaim
"In defense of the Electoral College , it can be a faster way to elect a new president ",Counterclaim
not everybody agrees on the concept of the Electoral College. ,Counterclaim
Many citzens disagree with the system of voting a president ,Counterclaim
Although the founding fathers of the countries establlished the electoral college ,Counterclaim
"While it might seem reasonable for larger states to have a larger impact than smaller states,",Counterclaim
Supporters also claim the focus on swing states is beneficial because residents of swing states should be more politically informed due to their state's importance in the election ,Counterclaim
"Although, they're are some reasons for retaining the Electoral College. A canidate would need trans-reginal appeal not just the appeal of one region. Or found in ""In the Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the Presdident""  Posner states ""The Electoral college restores some of the weight of the politicial balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution"". Last, pressure from run-off elections when a candidate doesn't win majority vote is subsided by the Electoral College. ",Counterclaim
"Some say that the Electoral College is a system worth keeping, because it provides a certain outcome and avoids run-off elections,",Counterclaim
Other sources say a tie would be unlikely.,Counterclaim
"Assuming that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election (23)""",Counterclaim
"Relying on the popular vote may make a tie more likely,",Counterclaim
"Even though the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of selecting a president. There are still at least two good reasons to keep it.",Counterclaim
"the electoral college method despites its lack of democrastic pedigree is still used today its because of its certainty of outcome the reason is because the winning candidate's share of the electoral college exceeds his share of the popular vote, and also avoids run off elections to happen.",Counterclaim
"Another reason why the electoral college method is still used today is as stated in source 3

because it restores weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal- appointment of the senate decreed in the constitution. The electoral colege requires a president candidate to have trans-regional appeal no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. ",Counterclaim
but isn't fair if we just abolish the electoral colledge. it gives the people what they want and it puts the right president in charge. ,Counterclaim
Everything that is rong with the electoral collage ,Counterclaim
because the Electoral College is not democratic enough that it should be done away with.,Counterclaim
"Although the people have no voice in the elections but instead the Electoral College, sometimes it is better to keep the old method.",Counterclaim
"According to the text ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible, and it happened in 2000 ",Counterclaim
"However, as we can se in the texts above, not everybody things like this ",Counterclaim
"Yet that has happened very rarely. (Posner, paragraph #16).",Counterclaim
The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised... ,Counterclaim
"There are also people that want to stay with keeping electoral college . The electoral college restores most of the weight on the political balance that by population in large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution.
",Counterclaim
"Thats the only good reason about the Electoral College, when voter numbers from each state have a huge difference apart and the electors cast their own vote,",Counterclaim
Some may think a cell phone will cause problems in class,Counterclaim
There are many cons to having cell phones in school ,Counterclaim
"I agree, sometimes students do get carried of with their phones ",Counterclaim
If students do break the rule of using it in class,Counterclaim
Taking phones away altogether just gives the students another reason to not enjoy school ,Counterclaim
I can probably guess that one of your concerns with the first policy is that students will take the new allowance too far and not only text during lunch and free periods but also during class time. ,Counterclaim
Another valid concern that you may have about the first policy is that there may be cyber bullying since the students would be able to text in school free times; and also since their have been many teen suicides recently due to cyber bullying.,Counterclaim
but at the same time it could distract them from their work. ,Counterclaim
i know we are not allowed to use our phones,Counterclaim
I know you don't like us using our cell phone,Counterclaim
 but I believe the staff of our school would personally like policy two better. ,Counterclaim
Yes cell phones at times can be distracting,Counterclaim
You may think what if students use their phones when the teacher turns around?,Counterclaim
"Yes, most of Americans use them to much, and they are a huge distraction most of the time",Counterclaim
Phones are very much over used in school ,Counterclaim
It is understandable why we would not be allowed to use them in the class room because it would be disruptive to others and disrespectful to the teacher ,Counterclaim
There are times when we may need to use our cell phones though.,Counterclaim
"I think that we should be able to bring our phones to school, because some of us may have sick family members or may be sick ourselves.",Counterclaim
Even though you say that it's still going to be bad and out of control ,Counterclaim
"Although you may think that if phones are allowed at school, students might be texting during class ",Counterclaim
"You might be saying, ""Why can't they just get up and walk over to their table and talk?""",Counterclaim
their could be the hazard of kids stealing other peoples phones.,Counterclaim
all though cells phone distract students from the work in class room and many other reason,Counterclaim
i know for a fact kids may disobey this rule,Counterclaim
"Even though there are good sides to having cell phones, I think having your cell phone and being able to use it should be a privilege.",Counterclaim
Also some students would say if they didn't have a phone how would their parents call if there is an emergency that is why it makes it an hard decision ,Counterclaim
Teachers and parents may say this is a bad thing because it might prevent students from learning ,Counterclaim
"Although I agree with policy one there are some risks to bringing your phone to school.
",Counterclaim
"Another reason policy two could be better is because most rumors start of as a text or something someone posts on like facebook.
",Counterclaim
"However, There are negatives to this policy as well. For example, after lunch, when phones are supposed to be turned off, students will not want to turn them off, due to the conversation that they were previously in because they still want to talk to this person(s).",Counterclaim
"Another example of a negative affect is that after lunch, or there free time, they could be distracted by a text that might have upset them, like a break up, gossip, or cyber bulling.",Counterclaim
"Also cheating is a problem with cell phones. Even though schools usually don't have service, it can lead to cheating, especially after lunch.",Counterclaim
It is also very important to not have cell phones in school.,Counterclaim
Since certain students will still text in class,Counterclaim
"
Other people may say cell phones are distracting, ",Counterclaim
granted a cell phone can be very useful during an emergency situation,Counterclaim
Not allowing students to use there phones at all,Counterclaim
Some of the teachers may think by bringing a phone to school is a sign of not having respect ,Counterclaim
"I know that the as the principal, you must have good reasons for Policy 1 such as it may be stolen. Cell phones do get stolen",Counterclaim
My opinion is that the teachers pick up their cell phones before class this might be bad if they steal them. ,Counterclaim
Maybe some students don't have cell phones and don't want other students to have them. ,Counterclaim
"But if you are going to install this rule, there must be some limits.",Counterclaim
Now I what you might be saying that the students are never going to leave their phones not even if there in class. ,Counterclaim
 Some would say if there was ever an emergency at the school they should be able to have their phone and call their parent,Counterclaim
 there are some kids that do use them during class,Counterclaim
Phones should only be allowed to be use at school when an emergency occurs like a fire ,Counterclaim
Some students would disagree with this,Counterclaim
Phones are a major distraction at school and is one of the main reasons students get in trouble some teachers are ok if the phone is in a purse or hidden and actually goes off others not so much. ,Counterclaim
"I know we can go a little overboard sometimes with all of this technology, ",Counterclaim
"Yes, a cell phone is a distraction in class with it buzzing in your pocket all day long,",Counterclaim
 they are a distraction,Counterclaim
" i could understand why you are considering making the policy so that we can not have are cell phones , in some cases you may think that it is interfering with our learning ",Counterclaim
When a child in trouble or something they need a cell phone to call someone. ,Counterclaim
When a teacher say students can bring the cell phones the phones got to be off during class,Counterclaim
"Although Policy 1 is a possible solution to the issue of students using their cell phones and their lack of attention during class it's just not a viable one.
",Counterclaim
"Although a phone is provided in the office,",Counterclaim
"Yes i understand that cell phones can only be used during free time, but most kids will not obey that rule or abuse that rule. ",Counterclaim
"Looking from the side of those who think you should choose your first policy, they might say that it's best for the student's safety, in the case of an emergency or personal problem.",Counterclaim
"Another thing they might say is that if kids are going to turn them off in class, there isn't a problem ",Counterclaim
"I feel that the rule , ""we can't use cell phones during school hours"" is sometimes reasonable . ",Counterclaim
"I also think that policy 2 is a good choice for no letting students bring cell phones to school, because if the students have their cell phones with them. the students might get distracted during class period, and not pay attention. ",Counterclaim
All though you can use them for urgent cares ,Counterclaim
 But some students in school have serious lack of concentration and being able to use phones in school would make it even more worse than it already is.,Counterclaim
"Yes, I think it is incredibly rude for a student to use their phone instead of listening to the teacher,",Counterclaim
I also see why the rule is no phones.,Counterclaim
"Although some people say students may sneak a little texting here or there, which is wrong ",Counterclaim
"If you use policy 2 students will bring them anyways. The more trouble students get in , the more work you'll have to do ",Counterclaim
They also have some disadvantage ,Counterclaim
 I know you probably think that people would go behind your back and leave there phones on,Counterclaim
We do get why teachers and principals don't want us to use phones.,Counterclaim
"Policy two does make sense to teachers because it wont, ""distract students from their work"". ",Counterclaim
But the first reason is also good cause there are some kids who would be able to restrain them self as well. ,Counterclaim
But saying phones aren't allowed would not be fair because of the good kids who use when allowed.,Counterclaim
"I can easily understand your leaning toward Policy 2, because you are a principal ",Counterclaim
Most student would be texting while in class instead of paying attention.,Counterclaim
sometimes there are student that doesn't do any work and just sit at text all day ,Counterclaim
I can see a lot of students being sneaky and conniving by using their phones in school.,Counterclaim
And what about the problems it would bring ,Counterclaim
"Even if you had the rule that we couldn't even bring them to school, how many people do you think would listen? I would probably bring mine out of habit, for if I have practices or if I stayed after school, but I never text or have my phone in class or even on for that matter. ",Counterclaim
 but i do understand they are older and do hold a bit more responsibility. So i do see why you haven't changed the rule.,Counterclaim
You may be think well that's good and all but i could just ban cell phones and all those problems would go away.,Counterclaim
The disadvantage is that there will probably be a lot of parents coming to the school to bring their kids stuff for class.,Counterclaim
"Even though most kids bring their cell phones to school anyway without permission,",Counterclaim
"Many students may use them during class when they are supposed to be paying attention to their teachers,",Counterclaim
this is also helpful,Counterclaim
"but cell phones can be a major distraction, especially when it comes to education",Counterclaim
"I am not saying that you won't have people sneaking them around still,",Counterclaim
Although I do firmly believe that cell phones should be treated as a privilege and not a toy.,Counterclaim
The only bad thing to this is that everyone knows that the students keep there phones on and the interruption to the class would be aggravating.,Counterclaim
"Policy 1 sounds like a particularly good idea because , one , students sometimes text during classes and school because they know they're not supposed to and doing so makes them feel like a rebel and like they have power.",Counterclaim
"Another thought , going back to policy 1 , is that if students could text during passing periods and lunch periods they may not have the need to want to text during class because they are being able to text during the school day. ",Counterclaim
"Policy 1 has some good strong points , having students be able to text during free times of the day ,",Counterclaim
 But there are some weak points to this policy also. ,Counterclaim
"I think that by not allowing us to bring them will cause us to rebel more and use them during class time, lunch time and virtually all day long,",Counterclaim
 Just as long as the phones are not distracting to us while we are learning,Counterclaim
"Although you can use the school's phone,",Counterclaim
Though there are many people who say letting people use phones in free time would cut down on texting,Counterclaim
"If you use policy two, and do not let students have phones at school at all, they will still be trying to text during lunch and free time.",Counterclaim
"I know that you are probably thinking that we are going to do things that we are not supposed to be doing,",Counterclaim
Policy 1 has disadvantages too.,Counterclaim
 I know that education is very important and that students should do as well as we can and get good grades.,Counterclaim
"If you chose Policy 2 i honestly think that students would bring them anyway and use them during class, causing them to not pay attention and make bad grades. ",Counterclaim
I could see if you were after school and you had to call your mom or somebody to pick you up ,Counterclaim
I will say that is they have a game of some type they can bring there phones but leave them in the office i can say yes to that because i understand that you are away and you want to let your parents know that your on your way to the game are school so they know when to come and pick you up ,Counterclaim
if that strategy doesn't function very well,Counterclaim
"However, not every child is a law abiding citizen of this beautiful country we call the United States of America.",Counterclaim
even thought there are many reasons students should not have cell phones in school,Counterclaim
I know most students won't be happy about not being able to bring their phones to school,Counterclaim
" However, if he doesn't have a phone; survival percentages are very slim.",Counterclaim
But i also think that if students get carried away using them until the fact that they use them during class ,Counterclaim
"Well, I agree with you that cell phones should be prohibited at certain times especially in class because they can become a distraction to not just that person, but people around them. It could cause some chaos between the teacher and the student as well. ",Counterclaim
"A cell phone as (many people know) does numerous things: You can check your E-mail, go on the internet, listen to music, watch videos etc ",Counterclaim
Some people might think it should not be allowed because phones are a distraction. ,Counterclaim
"Some teachers say its a bad thing to let students use their phones or electronics during free periods,",Counterclaim
I could see where there would be some trouble with kids who simply don't care,Counterclaim
In the other hand if you choose the first policy of no cell phones during school. Students will still use them and it will become a bigger problem because they will use them during class.,Counterclaim
"Although many people would say that the children would just continue their lunchtime conversations during class and break the rules,",Counterclaim
There's many reasons for students to NOT bring their cell phone to school ,Counterclaim
"Take it from a student, most rules are broken so I really doubt students aren't going to stop bringing their phones to school for example in our school gum isn't allowed but students continue to bring gum and chew it in school the rules and the detention doesn't stop them.",Counterclaim
To me I say that Policy 1 is a good choice to make but not so much,Counterclaim
I know that cell phones may cause a problem for teachers,Counterclaim
 cell phones may cause some problems in class,Counterclaim
"I agree that cell phones should not be used during class,",Counterclaim
Now if the texting begins to be a problem in class then i think you should take away the rule and allow no cell phones in school.,Counterclaim
Also i would use policy 2 cause no one would for get to turn off their cell phones ,Counterclaim
People may use some excuses like if they're was an emergency. ,Counterclaim
"The only minor problem is that students might not turn them off during class, disregarding your trust and rules. ",Counterclaim
Sometimes they do go off during class ,Counterclaim
"I know what your thinking, if we let students bring cell phones to school they will get distracted and ignore their teachers.",Counterclaim
"As I said earlier, there are exceptions, limits and cons. Examples are when kids are sexting, cyber bullying, or inappropriately using their phones. ",Counterclaim
Unless your using it in class,Counterclaim
"This may seem like it absurd to let kids bring their cell phones to school because of the distraction,
",Counterclaim
There might be cons to this policy,Counterclaim
People might try texting in class if they are allowed to have their cell phones ,Counterclaim
Students might also be distracted during times when they are supposed to be studying if they have phones ,Counterclaim
Let's say we did let us text whenever we had free time,Counterclaim
A big deal for teachers is that the students are paying attention to their phones and not the lesson in class ,Counterclaim
Now I know why you may want students to not use phones. Students can cheat on tests by looking online or texting. Also you don't want students to text during class and other times when they shouldn't ,Counterclaim
I know there are a lot of down sides to having cell phones in school like cheating or distraction ,Counterclaim
"But i understand that some parents and school principles are taking them out of school class rooms or even the whole campus,",Counterclaim
Then again they shouldn't bring their phone because they might text during class taking up the time they need so they can learn ,Counterclaim
I also don't think we should have cell phones in school,Counterclaim
I know that our parents can call the office to let us know,Counterclaim
The only non benefits i can think of from this plan is that students might still use their phones in class,Counterclaim
Although there are some kids that still use their phone during class,Counterclaim
"
That may be a issue if a kid is behind because they probably be texting instead of getting there work done ",Counterclaim
Their is always the argument that cell phones may help students get rid of stress by talking to someone when no others can hear. ,Counterclaim
I understand that the staff must be frustrated with all the texting during class and I will admit that sometimes cell phone rings disrupt the class. ,Counterclaim
"Many teachers respond to that with, ""Well one bad apple ruins whole bunch,"" ",Counterclaim
"Although, the only true downside to this is if your texting it does not always get to the other persons phone right away, depending on the amount of signal you or they have it could take 5 seconds or it could take 30 minutes",Counterclaim
"The only problem i can see by allowing this is if you drop your phone, leave it somewhere, or its been stolen. ",Counterclaim
"Now for not allowing them in class I understand, the way I see it is because students will, most likely, most of their time texting or calling friends or family about what they are going to do after school ",Counterclaim
The only bad part in policy #1 is that phones should be turned of during class time. ,Counterclaim
A sometimes we should not bring our phones,Counterclaim
You may think that cell phones should not be aloud at school,Counterclaim
 I mean sure if students aren't allowed to use their phone at all because of school rules then they might be willing to not use it because they wouldn't want it taken away. ,Counterclaim
they could get distracted in calling everyone,Counterclaim
If policy two was implemented students would ignore the rule and bring and hide them anyways.,Counterclaim
The only problem with you letting us have phones i school is that kids will text in class and use them for reasons they should not be used for during school hours. ,Counterclaim
Policy #1 does state to let kids use phone's during free times or so and to turn off their phone's during class sessions . Now it's not a bad idea,Counterclaim
"I understand that we should be kept free of distractions such as cell phones during the time when attention needs to be on learning, and not on incoming calls or texts",Counterclaim
Some student may misuse the use of cell phones,Counterclaim
I know that some people wont use there phones the way you tell them to like them texting people with them,Counterclaim
Cell phones are great for communication,Counterclaim
Though sneaking cell phones in classrooms are an issue in this option.,Counterclaim
"There is an issue of students turning off their cell phone alarms during free times,",Counterclaim
"There is also another problem with students turning off the alarms during class,",Counterclaim
"Cell phones can be a bad thing at schools though, because they can get very distracting. ",Counterclaim
"So if we had 'Policy 2', you'd run up to the teacher at the podium; and ask to call your guardian.",Counterclaim
I think it would be a good thing to a least try. If kids were not following the rules for the phones ,Counterclaim
 I know the teachers think we will abuse the opportunity to use our cell phones.,Counterclaim
"True teenagers at times are irresponsible and they don't care about they're body and true they are lazy and don't right correct spelling and not only that but get distracted with they're phones and focus less on they're studies , ",Counterclaim
There are some reason I believe you should enforce this policy. I know your thinking what if the students pull out their cell phone during class. ,Counterclaim
However the downside to this policy is some that students may disobey this rule,Counterclaim
"Comparing the first policy to the second, the second policy about not having any phones in the school has at least one advantage ",Counterclaim
"However, allowing the students to use their cell phones, would boost their morale, and make them happier ",Counterclaim
"Now, there are also some down sides to letting student have their phones at school.",Counterclaim
Another down side to it is that if they are at lunch texting their friends they are not be social with the people around them. Also something else is that they might be texting or talking to their friends from other schools who could be in class and in turn they are disturbing their learning time as well. ,Counterclaim
There are also some up sides about it,Counterclaim
If you ended up choosing policy 2 don't think students would kick back and just listen to that rule.,Counterclaim
"Cell phones can come to use once in a while; if you need to contact a parent or guardian, or if there is an emergency, your able to call some one right away. ",Counterclaim
There is one that I disagree on in policy #1 is that student should not have to turn there phones of during time in class.,Counterclaim
 I understand that you may have some type of emergency and if you need to contact your parents or other family members for help,Counterclaim
There are some negatives for having phones out to though. ,Counterclaim
"Some students are known for goofing off and not listening.
",Counterclaim
i love my cell phone and like to talk and text to my friends all the time,Counterclaim
I know that not all technology is bad,Counterclaim
But sometimes it isn't good to have phones at all in school ,Counterclaim
"Although, some students shall not have a cell phone",Counterclaim
"But i also may think that its a bad idea because if more kids are being allowed to bring their cell phones to school that might cause more bullying and problems like phones getting lost, stole, broken and possibly taking when in class because students mite for get to turn it on silent or off before classes.
",Counterclaim
 I acknowledge that some students are irresponsible.,Counterclaim
Other may not want to consult to their teachers about using their phones at certain periods of time.,Counterclaim
" Some may say that students don't care,",Counterclaim
Teachers believe students shouldn't have phones period because of the unnecessary usage of the phones in school. ,Counterclaim
"Of course you could argue that if you let kid shave their phones out during passing periods and lunch, they might use them during class. That is an understandable argument, ",Counterclaim
"I understand that some kids bring their phones and text or use the internet during class,",Counterclaim
"If you choose policy two, I don't think people would be very happy ",Counterclaim
"If you select the alternative policy, and not the first policy than students would not be allowed to have them of use at school at all",Counterclaim
"I understand how some people would say that this will make more chaos,",Counterclaim
If you see a problem to this policy then of course you may go ahead and band cellular devices from the school.,Counterclaim
Teachers may like policy two better because of not having to worry about having a phone in class ,Counterclaim
"If students chose to waste the time stated to use there phones, and try to use them during class time",Counterclaim
"You and I know that kids will still try to text during class,",Counterclaim
 if you don't then they will hate you for ever and do bad stuff to you,Counterclaim
"Hopefully the students will not use their cell phone in class and break the rules,",Counterclaim
But what happen if its an emergency and a student didn't bring his phone because his school do not allow cell phones? ,Counterclaim
You might tell the students to use the school phones ,Counterclaim
"Sure, using your phone outside of school to contact your friend is reasonable.",Counterclaim
"I know teachers and the principal wouldn't want to allow cell phones because it might be a distraction. Well yes maybe sometimes,",Counterclaim
The only thing bad is students could bring them to class and secretly text or some other thing and it could possibly bring there grades down ,Counterclaim
"I think sometimes phones are problem while using during class, ",Counterclaim
But it will be different if the students were just a little quiet with the cell phones,Counterclaim
But there are some disadvantages to having cell phones in school.,Counterclaim
"Policy 2, would help with students texting in class. It could also help with students texting during a test and telling each other answers.",Counterclaim
"Some students may run the risk of something happening to they're phones like them losing them, or breaking them, or getting them stolen.",Counterclaim
"All most all adults would not a agree with me they say ""We were kids not to long ago"". ",Counterclaim
Some of the kids that don't have cell phones may be resentful that they don't and that's why they say its such a big distraction. ,Counterclaim
"Many teachers may say,"" No, students will use them during class and that it's just an interruption"", ",Counterclaim
"Yes, it is true some students won't turn off their phone in class,",Counterclaim
"Yea staff may say,"" No they're going to be calling people to do something dumb or may even call parents to pick them up."" ",Counterclaim
"Teachers also say,"" NO PHONES in the locker room"", Because some students act immature and start taking pictures of other people or send forwards about a person, wich can hurt someone in many ways. Some students may even use them in class or in the library,",Counterclaim
I think your idea about getting cell phones out of the school totally is a little bit to hard on the kids .I understand why you don't want cell phones in the school ,Counterclaim
"I see that during class, phones can be very distracting,",Counterclaim
"Even though these events are rare,",Counterclaim
Even if someone did have a cell phone out,Counterclaim
Some schools are zero tolerance and very strict.,Counterclaim
All though policy 2 isn't such a good idea but it will teach the students to not text during school.,Counterclaim
"Don't take those excuses of ""Oh but I need my phone to tell my mom that I'm coming home late!"" or

""I need to tell RELATIVE_NAME

that I can't come over after school! Please let me use my phone!""",Counterclaim
"However, there may be students that will take this experience for granted. You can take that away form them which is only fair.",Counterclaim
I agree that some students may be using them during class and they should not have the privilege to use them anymore in school. ,Counterclaim
"I know that the students tend to use it during class, ",Counterclaim
Now there is a problem with it. What if people over use the privilege and use there phones during class time ,Counterclaim
You may be worried about us using them during class ,Counterclaim
"Policy one is fair, but the students don't think it's fair.",Counterclaim
 it is also a bad thing to have a phone because if a student looses a phone the student will make a big scene ,Counterclaim
Of coarse Policy 2 isn't wrong because many kids use their cell phones for wrong reasons such as picking fights and texting during class and using them to cheat on test which is wrong,Counterclaim
"I know the school faculty might say that they can enforce the rules, and even the student's might say they will behave with their phones ",Counterclaim
 I think the reason why are principle wont let us use are phone is because there afraid that if someone phones get stolen or lost the school would have to be responsible for it or be in charge. Also a lot of teachers recommend us students not to use them during class or any were else ,Counterclaim
"Third, there is a few students that might say they would not want cell phones to be allowed in school because they can be very distracting in lots of ways.",Counterclaim
Some teachers wouldn't want their students to use their cell phones because they might do something foolish and iresponsible ,Counterclaim
"There may be some issues when first putting the policy in order,",Counterclaim
Policy 2 would be a good policy too ,Counterclaim
yes they have a bigger possibly of being late,Counterclaim
Students should have there phone during school because if there is am emergency that couldn't even call the office they should have there phones on vibrate.,Counterclaim
Some advantages to the second policy is that there would be no more cell phone interruptions in the classroom.,Counterclaim
"I know that there are several negative points in allowing students to bring cell phones to school, such as classroom disruption, thefts and damages to mentioned devices ",Counterclaim
People sometimes use cell phones to often,Counterclaim
Texting in class is a problem and it need to stopped.,Counterclaim
In the video only one time does it show that a students phone is being used during class ,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, students could use this policy against the teachers and claim that they conveniently 'forgot' to turn off their cell phones, and were 'just checking if it was important' ",Counterclaim
But I kind of disagree because if we have our break and we are done with using our phone some people disobey the teacher and use their phones in class or when they are suppose to put their phones in their locker use them during any time the teacher is not looking so I kind of agree with Policy 2.,Counterclaim
they could just go to the front office and use the phone there.,Counterclaim
there gona take advantage of it,Counterclaim
"BUT

some people will text in class and u guys wont know",Counterclaim
kids could bring their cell phones too school but to have them off before entering there classes ,Counterclaim
Even though we students use them during class,Counterclaim
If they use there phones during class,Counterclaim
" But, if you do go through with this rule, you have to make the students turn off the devices, and remove them from their presence.",Counterclaim
Some teachers say that we are not allow to use our phones in school because we get distracted or we just do not complete our work. ,Counterclaim
"Yes, sometimes it is nice to have your cell phone out for a calculator (if you are allowed to use one) or even to call your parents if there is a big emergency happening at the school,",Counterclaim
The only thing wrong with that is kids will have their cell phones on in classes and text when they are not supposed to.,Counterclaim
"If you ban the use of cell phones at school, it cannot stop the students from bringing them. You can stop children from using their phones on paper,",Counterclaim
I also believe don't allow student to have phone at school at all is another bad idea because what if student needs to call home call someone else what if a group of student are walking to school and someone got shot ,Counterclaim
I can see reasons why students are not allowed to bring their cell phones ,Counterclaim
There are also many reasons of why you should make it be in the policy number two. ,Counterclaim
I see why people wouldn't want cell phones at school like they could be distractions ,Counterclaim
"Of course, things can get out of hand, since the phone is a way of communication. Bad things about one another can be said and can start confrontations or fights ",Counterclaim
Policy two is a bad idea because kids should have there phones just in case of an emergency ,Counterclaim
Some people may argue that there are phones at school that the students can use and that they should have their parents pick them up instead of walking home. They also may say that cell phones are a distraction in class. ,Counterclaim
most student would still bring there phones anyway ,Counterclaim
" If I was a teacher I would not let my students have there phones out. I would not tolerate it,",Counterclaim
 But the bad side of policy number 2 is that they would not be able to call there parents after school to pick them up. ,Counterclaim
"Yeah, it would be nice to use our cell phones,",Counterclaim
having cell phones at school could tempt other students to text or call their parents to pick them up for early dismissal or a feign sickness. ,Counterclaim
"If any student is caught using their phones during class,",Counterclaim
"There is however one exception to the general rule of no cell phones. that is in the case of an emergency, such as a fire or a hostage situation.",Counterclaim
"Attending classes from home gives students a sense of protection and comfort.
",Counterclaim
Some may say that exposure to these parts of society aren't needed in future situations. ,Counterclaim
It is possible to be said that professionalism isn't used for every given situation in adulthood. ,Counterclaim
"It is possible for distance learning students to participate in some activities,",Counterclaim
Some may say that distance learning is an opportunity for one to do extracurriculars not involving school. ,Counterclaim
"Distance learning is an idea that can be understood for those who are incapable of travel to learn and receive a fair education along with those who are able to.

It can give good opportunities for those people to be educated without consequence or strenuous complications. ",Counterclaim
"While some may argue that distance learning allows for more concentration,",Counterclaim
Some may say this will leave students lazy and not have the initiative to leave their house or bedroom ,Counterclaim
On the other hand parents still think that it is healthy to let their children go to schools that have those bad environments. Most of the parents say that it helps them be more social and keeps them from staying in the house too often.,Counterclaim
"Most, adults may argue that this is a false narrative because of the of outlets that the education system may offer to students.",Counterclaim
While some people believe students learning online is better because students are more comfortable than they would be in a classroom and it's more convenient for them;,Counterclaim
"In the other hand, I think that this program it won't help to those students who distract easy or those who don't do work without any person who will persuade them to do the work ",Counterclaim
"Yes, there would be specific time to join the conference call, or to watch a lesson and complete the work",Counterclaim
"Maybe people dont want the traditional way of school to change, and they enjoy getting up early and sitting in class to learn ",Counterclaim
Some people may claim that online school makes a student lazy because they will procrastinate ,Counterclaim
"In order to address those opposed, it is understandable for anyone to do so, but not forgivable. Many would say that the students would lose their friends, that they might become awkward, and that students might even cheat on assessments.",Counterclaim
"While online learning may be a good fix for a lot of these issues it could open up new problems as well. Students could use their phones to search for answers to a variety of tests or share their answers with friends via text message. Their is no end to the creativity of someone who wants to cheat on an assignment,",Counterclaim
"Some would argue that their are students who want to continue learning when they are not at school, and they will be the ones to do the work assigned and benefit from it.
",Counterclaim
"Although some say students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because sometimes, students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class,",Counterclaim
" Some stuudents may not be able to handle the responsibility that they are given with the online courses,",Counterclaim
"Yes, some students could take this freedom and completely throw their education out of the window. They could just let their classes sit, and they would fail.",Counterclaim
Some people may not agree with that statement,Counterclaim
Most students think it is easier to go to school at home. They think it is easier to go to school at home rather than at a real school because you have more sleep time. You can still enjoy the rest of your day without going to school.,Counterclaim
"In spite of, many individuals believe that there would be far more distractions for students at home than there are at school with the use of online classes ",Counterclaim
Some could argue that being out of school gives student more time to do other activities like chores and family socials ,Counterclaim
"Although there may be less teachers within the schools systems, ",Counterclaim
"Although some students may not enjoy learning from the comfort of their own home,",Counterclaim
the challenge of studying at school wil not be similarity to the challenge of taking classes at home ,Counterclaim
"Some people may argue that is not fair whether you taking classes at school,home,or online you still have same education and academies in excellectual way",Counterclaim
One of the highest point of this people who supporting the students are taking classes at home is. The student will have enough time to do many work than students who are taking classes at school,Counterclaim
t that how they think i do not.,Counterclaim
" at home student may cheat not body knows, whether he complited task or not. No one have to care. That the bid different you may see. Because is said the meaangless of student who work by himself he will never feel couragoues like other it is hard. Even to trust what he is doing sometimes nor always. ",Counterclaim
On the other hand. If you are at home you can eat and do whatever you want when you want. ,Counterclaim
There are still a few reasons not to do distanced learning. There are many more opportunities with public schools ,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, a myriad of people argue that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. They claim that pupils would have more freedom and less distraction.",Counterclaim
"Although there is still the at home distraction or the possibility that the student does not have internet connection where ever they might go,",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, some may argue that online schooling helps Students who are on home bound. Kids often get hurt from participating in sports or just playing outside. This results in them going on home bound from school. Children who are on home bound can benefit from online school by staying afloat in their classes and also keeping in the seven to three schedule of learning. ",Counterclaim
The opposition incorrectly believe that with the help of online or video conferencing students will benefit less from being able to attend classes from home because students would be less social and they will not be able to gain communication skills. ,Counterclaim
"Though, because the student would be at home, they might be more easily distracted. Another reason why this would be a bad idea is that, school is a place of learning ,but it is also the place people learn valuable social skills. ",Counterclaim
"Though, if they learn from home they would have more things much more interesting than school. What's going to keep them focused ",Counterclaim
 Or they can go focus on that random shiny thing in the corner.,Counterclaim
Although students who don't have access to WIFI at home may be a problem,Counterclaim
"Critics would argue that if students get home schooled they wouldn't get to go out explore the real world. Also, they would fear to talk to people they don't know and only talk to people they do know and that would affect the way the interact with others and could effect the way they attend colleges or interviews for jobs or colleges",Counterclaim
Critics would argue that many students would get sick still.,Counterclaim
"Also, being home sick could affect the way you learn at home ",Counterclaim

"Although at home learning may benefit some students, teachers may need to do twice the work to ensure the distance learning students know the material ",Counterclaim
"Some may say, that people who attend classes from home, will slack off and not learn anything. This is because there are not as many authoritative figures around to execute and remind these students of what is to be done.",Counterclaim
"many people think that attending classes from home is not the same, that the knowledge they are receiving is not as strong as the one they receive while being at school.",Counterclaim
Some may try to argue that many people like being alone and would prefer it. ,Counterclaim

Some people may also argue that the students are going to cheat as there will be no teacher with them checking,Counterclaim
"If I approach the other side of distance learning, I can say that students may feel more relaxed and their courses may allow them to have flexible schedules, which is something students have difficulty maintaining when going to school physically. ",Counterclaim

"As great as distance learning sounds it, as with all decisions, does not come without drawbacks. Tackling possibly it's biggest problem, distance learning has a high technological dependency to function efficiently and having tech means spending lots of money.
",Counterclaim
"In contrast, reciving classes online can be a good option for does students that don't have the resources to go to school.",Counterclaim
"however, it could get hard by not getting the help they want from an actual computer during any time of the day.
",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, there are students who need more of a face to face help than only getting the contact they need from a person through a device ",Counterclaim
Many schools started online classes due to emergencies or some students arent able to attend school everyday,Counterclaim
"Although some may say online classes are helpful because students can do school work on their own time,they wont have to wait until a teacher gives them instructions for assignments ",Counterclaim
"Students also can invite their friends over their houses and work togather on assignments but they can also copy eachother on tests,quizes or even homework. ",Counterclaim
Many students and teachers are interested in attending classes from home or by online video conferencing.,Counterclaim
The bad part about this idea though is students will not learn how to socialize or how to make good connections with people. Also if a student loses their internet access or has a power outage their is no way for them to attend class besides going to a nearby place with internet ,Counterclaim
"But I do see that is not really the same as school, i see the point, that it would be lonely for some people to just do school at home and not really have the social life that school gives them. ",Counterclaim
"Regardless of what educational system is in place, whether traditional learning or distance learning, there will be the students that wont study, will copy their friend's homework, and will cheat on test, its unavoidable;",Counterclaim
"But you know some students think different about things like this some students might want get it done then and there. Not waste any other free time they may get to do any work. Like some students might take this as an advantage and get as much work done as possible so they have the extra free time other days.
",Counterclaim
"And some students have jobs they might want to get they're work done in the morning and go to work come home and not have any work to do when they come home
",Counterclaim
The pros of taking online classes I would say is being at home ,Counterclaim
"The idea of implementing online learning programs on a national level to isolate students and staff from contagious illness and disease perhaps sounds bombastic and reactionary at a first glance,",Counterclaim
"Better focus, however, does not solely stem from a comfortable learning environment,",Counterclaim
Attending online classes have a lot of disabilities to teach a student they way they need to be teaching. A teacher can show us how to use a good language with other people but an online class wouldn't be able to do that ,Counterclaim
"Although providing online classes would allow more people to learn and grow their brain, I do believe it is more beneficial for a student to be working in school than from home.",Counterclaim
"Despite the many bonuses that distance learning offers, there is something that can be said about the social aspect of traditional public schooling. By forcing students to interact with one another, traditional schools facilitate social interactions between peers.",Counterclaim
"Aluthough, many of said taking online classes in home has disadantage because students get easly distarcted and can't improve themselves. ",Counterclaim
"While some may argue that online learning takes away the one-on-one time between students and teachers that is necessary for learning,",Counterclaim
"Others may think that taking online courses are a waste of time. Parents question the school district ""

if we have teachers then why do we need online courses?"". ",Counterclaim
Some students may say that it takes time from their free time ,Counterclaim
"However, many people will say that doing online school won't benefit the students. Most people will say that doing online school wouldn't benefit the students because they wouldn't do the work. Another reason people would say that online school wouldn't benefit the school is they wouldn't understand the lesson. Another reason is they wouldnt make any friends.",Counterclaim
"However, public schools provide a more precise education.",Counterclaim
" Furthermore, In schools, kids can learn topics that they might not be able to learn from online classes.",Counterclaim
"Even thought some people might say students shouldn't take classes in online because they can not learn good enough, they might be distracted or even ask any question to solve their problem,",Counterclaim
"While the option of enrolling in an online course can be beneficial to some,",Counterclaim
Being able to study from the comfort of one's home is a warm and inviting concept.,Counterclaim
I haven't talked about the other side of the story.,Counterclaim
"The more common argument that I hear is that students will not get any interacting with other classmates, therefore making them anti-social ",Counterclaim
they should use these options when there is bad weather or ice roads outside,Counterclaim
students who got injuries and cannot come to school for 1 month because there doctor gave him or her bed rest for 1 month this option can help him so that he or she do not miss there whole month so that they can keep up with there grades so that he or she do not fall back and they can get there diploma. ,Counterclaim
some students who work 5 to 6 days in a week and cannot get up early in the morning this program can help them to get there diploma by staying and taking there test online and video conferencing with there teacher.,Counterclaim
I understand that some people may disagree and prefer students to go to a normal school since they are going to have more social life.,Counterclaim
Many may believe that online school doesn't teach students what is required. I understand why some might think this because students who learn from home usually have a lot of free time.,Counterclaim
"It is a known fact that, if given the opportunity, most people would chose to partner up with a friend to work on an assignment. Working with peers, especially in school, may seem like a good idea at a first glance,",Counterclaim
"Distance learning also has concerns of using too much technology, not interacting with peers, and missing out on school events ",Counterclaim
"However, some may argue that some students will abuse this system so they could stay home because they wish to skip class and be lazy or maybe just want to stay home. ",Counterclaim
"Some students might argue that going to school is much is easier than online schools,",Counterclaim
"Though, being able to ask your teacher questions relating to the topic can be helpful. ",Counterclaim
"Studying online is not a easy way to learn something,",Counterclaim
"However, many people would not agree with this position, Some might argue that students can get distracted by being at home or that they might not have the same feeling of studying at their home then at school.",Counterclaim
"Even if some extracurricular activities are offered,",Counterclaim
"Even if students have to view the online class by a certain time to get credit,",Counterclaim
"Yes, you could say there are students that just want a chance to learn and dont care for the social aspect of school. ",Counterclaim
there is no argument that public schools are full of distractions. Especially with the technological advancement of phones.,Counterclaim
"To give credit where credit is due. I can see why primarily home schooling most students is a good idea. It allows students to be in a possibly more comforting environment. students are able to work at there own pace, whatever that may be ",Counterclaim
Although it would be more helpful to just attend class face to face ,Counterclaim
"Now, some students might not experience the ""school"" life and possibly miss out on the culture of attending school event and making lifelong friends.",Counterclaim
Some argue that online school isn't as good as going to regular school because students can miss out on unique opportunities and experiences found only in a traditional classroom.,Counterclaim
"Some people will say ""It'll give them the chance to be more independent, and learn to do things on their own. ",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, I feel like this could work.",Counterclaim
People will believe this could hurt the students who try to get everything done faster to have more free time during the day.,Counterclaim
"Although some people, like Generic_Name's parents, believe that schools offering students to attend classes from home will keep them from comimg to school ",Counterclaim
"Some think distance learning is not beneficial however,students should be able to attend classes online and join a video conference ",Counterclaim
in my opinion others might think it is better to go to school.,Counterclaim
"However, attending classes from home may provide more of a comfort to students who prefer to be independent and in a comfortable environment when learning.",Counterclaim
Half of the students wouldn't take it serious because they are at home and feel like they can just do anything because there's no teacher in their face,Counterclaim
Others may feel that with distance learning students would get more distracted than they would if they had someone guiding them through the assignment;,Counterclaim
Some people may say that there are also some people that are not able to come to school because of some specific reason or some people are influenced in a bad way at school ,Counterclaim
"Some say that students are going to have a harder time learning from home due to all the distractions. While yes that does makes sense, ",Counterclaim
"Though there are people who say that it's best for students to learn at school, because they can ask their teachers and other students for help. ",Counterclaim
"critics may say student go online to study what they learned, but they won't do online schooling.",Counterclaim
"However, there are some students who are not able to learn from an online course, or they can't learn from a video.",Counterclaim
Some people would disagree with this position. Some may argue that if schools offer online classes it would benefit students.,Counterclaim
"Although the video conferencing software might include a messaging system for students to communicate with their teachers,",Counterclaim
Some students prefer to have online,Counterclaim
There are some people who believe that attending school in a conventional setting is essential to students so that they can interact with others and understand topics with face to face lessons ,Counterclaim
Those who believe schools should offer online classes have reasons. They believe that students will have flexible schudeles during the day. It will help students to relieve strees and to work if they have a part-time job. They also think that students will become more responsable attending classes from home. Doing their work in their own will develop a self- decipline. ,Counterclaim
"Although distance learning limits the amount of school the student would miss from illnesses and potentially provides a wider variety of classes for a student, distance learning does not allow the student to have the social aspect that traditional school has. ",Counterclaim
"
however some students are not agree to come to school because they might not like to wake up early every morning or deal with others ",Counterclaim
Opponents argue that online or video conferencing learning would be beneficial to students more than learning in a classroom,Counterclaim
On the other hand people might think that taking online classes is bad because you don't get the in class experience.,Counterclaim
"Older generations have a different opinion on this idea. They think that the new generations are becoming too lenient, they say that you'll be put in uncomfortable situations all the time in the real world, and life isn't always about comfort.",Counterclaim
"Students are benefiting from online classes but, some students comeback into public schools because they learn better face to face with a teacher, and not steering at a screen all day.",Counterclaim
Some school say schools should offer distance learning classes because that way students have more time to do other activities,Counterclaim
"Some people say that the idea of students attend classes online from home will have more benefits is a bad idea, because they say,""Teenagers are lazy, and they will sleep more late at night"". ",Counterclaim
"Although online classes are the solution for some students,",Counterclaim
on he other hand there is the possibility that a student can afford a compter or tablet to participate in the proceedings ,Counterclaim
"One might argue that distance learning could enable cheating, ",Counterclaim
Sometime using technology can be a bad thing as well. Many of the thing we do at school can help us in the real world. One of the thing that school help us with is social skills.,Counterclaim
Another reason why school help is that some student many not have the money to own an electronic or many have really bad connection to the internet.,Counterclaim
 The third reason is the student not doing the program at all.,Counterclaim
"On the other hand,

some argue that students will use the distance learning less as a tool, but more as a crutch, so that they don't have to attend classes and can stay home whenever they want. People believe that the longer that students are required to show up and are given less options to make it up at home ,the more drive to show up at school will be seen.",Counterclaim
The numbers decrease because students felt that being home all day was boring. No being able to share ideas with other students or get engage with them. Students thought they needed more activities and less standing in only one place.,Counterclaim
"Many folks from the area in 2009 thought that this online classes were useless, because since it was opened for anyone less and less students will attend to school.",Counterclaim
"
However, even if they won't be able to go through or worry about tardiness if taking distant classes ",Counterclaim
Many argue that learning from home is better than learning at school due to convenience. ,Counterclaim
Those who believed not being able to attend classes fom home wouldn't benefit students because they can't work with other students ,Counterclaim
But some moms and dads dont think its good for them kids ,Counterclaim
but they might be a little sad because they dont get to see there friends as much when there at home doing there school work ,Counterclaim
"Like everything, online school also has its cons. If someone just genuinely did not like school and tried everything to avoid it in the first place, then obviously online school would not be for them. If a normal social person tried doing online school, it would probably be more harmful than helpful because it could lead them to shutting themselves out from not being able to meet anyone or make plans in person with anyone. Kids struggling with illnesses such as depression might not be able to keep up with the online classes and end up falling behind anyways ",Counterclaim
One may state that distance learning will make cheating a lot easier. ,Counterclaim
"While online courses provide comfort for a student at home,",Counterclaim
"The reality is that taking online classes may be benefical in recieving the basic education from the comfort of home, ",Counterclaim
"Although, some people may argue that taking virtual school at home is more beneficial for students,",Counterclaim
"many kids take avantange of home school some of those kids, they have parents that travel around the world and they dont have a chance to sit down and talk about what is going on in school or the everyday life, ",Counterclaim
Although I understand that it is important to be able to complete assignments quickly for the future ,Counterclaim
"However, this can be difficult when there are constant distractions in the classroom",Counterclaim
"While trusting students to learn independently may not be appropriate for every student, ",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, the online class is not really useless thing that for the students.",Counterclaim
Although people say that online school is better so you don't get bullied ,Counterclaim
"However, some would argue that public schools teach students how to socially interact with people in the outside world and how to effectively deal with pressure/stress and disappointments, while attending online classes from home does not properly teach these important life skills.",Counterclaim
Next i think not because some people are better hands on then working on there computers.,Counterclaim
However other migth say the students attend classes form home is the best thing they can do because they dont need to do all that monring things they can just open the laptop and join there teacher form the web cam and learn,Counterclaim
"Although some people may say this can be prevented but,",Counterclaim
" A down side to this is the fact that some students just will not complete the work they are assigned, or they will procrastinate for as long as they are able to ",Counterclaim
Some might prefer to have an expierience of going to collage or making memories; ,Counterclaim
It still could bring some concerns. One could be they don't have the access to receive it. ,Counterclaim
Some may disagree that classes at school are beneficial because it doesn't allow student to learn at their own pace ,Counterclaim
"Some may argue that online conferencing helps increase availability of education,",Counterclaim
Contrary to what many believes,Counterclaim
Many people believe home schooling is a way better option then being at school because it creates more of a comfortable environment for the students ,Counterclaim
"Meanwhile, many people say it is the best thing to do ",Counterclaim
"Although this choice allows students to get assignments done when they are not able to attend public school,",Counterclaim
But some downsides are you are less social because you don't attend classes with anyone else it's just you and a computer. ,Counterclaim
Many people may argue that students should take classes online instead of going to school.,Counterclaim
Some may argue that students should not be able to take online classes or have private video conferences.,Counterclaim
I did have many complications when I was there,Counterclaim
Some people think students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home.,Counterclaim
 Some may disagree by saying after the class is completed they can just go outside and do an extracurricular activity ,Counterclaim
Some students say they only look up answers to the questions they don't know. ,Counterclaim
"Lastly, some ways it could be negative is that students may cheat.",Counterclaim
First it was hard to interact with others so I suggested to my family about homeschooling,Counterclaim
People might simply say why can't students learn by online class.,Counterclaim
"In contrast, there might be students who prefer studying by a way of online or video conferencing",Counterclaim
"Some students would say its better to come to school, meet people and have the high school experiences. Although it sounds fun.",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, others believe that having their child stay home to do his/her class work can keep them out of trouble.

I do not disagree with the fact that it could keep them out of trouble ",Counterclaim
Even though there are a lot of benefits to having the ability to access classes online people may argue that going to school is still better for the student then staying at home. ,Counterclaim
Although some may say allowing online classes can take away from the high school experience,Counterclaim
"Although some may say students may cheat or slack off during online classes,",Counterclaim
While some may say online classes encourages shortcuts to be made,Counterclaim
"Though many students find this method endearing,",Counterclaim
" you might think with taking online classes your life would be much easier, because you don't come to school and obviously you are going to have more time for anything else ",Counterclaim
"But there is people that don't think the same, my father always told me that eduaction is the base of all, and in some way an online class its never going to be the same as a ""common"" class, it can have cons and pros. ",Counterclaim
"However, in some cases the distance learning from the home can be beneficial.",Counterclaim
"Some may say that getting on an electronic device rather than going to school to attend classes can be more tiring and stressful, because that would include staring at a screen for countless hours. Some may also complain that there isnt a person teaching the subjects ",Counterclaim
"While yes there are distractions inside the houses of the students like TV's, video games, their phones, and so on ",Counterclaim
"While yes there is somethings that could go wrong like internet outage, students not doing the work cause no one is there to watch, and so on.",Counterclaim
"Some people may say that taking online classes is overall, not beneficial to students because it isolates them from other people their age and doesn't allow them to have the best education possible.",Counterclaim
Some may argue that student should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing ,Counterclaim
"Although many students will like this idea taking classes at home by just grabbing their computers or phone and ready to study. Their is a main reason why they would like t because their will not be teachers' to tell them where to sit, to be quiet or getting in trouble.
",Counterclaim
"I have given you three reasons on how doing your classes online can be benificial, but there are also some disadvantages. One of them could be not interacting with other students.",Counterclaim
"Although some say that learning from home is counter intuitive,",Counterclaim
"There would be possible downsides, though. It is almost certain that a few students, the kind that you see vaping, or sitting in the back of the class, never doing their work, would take advantage of the out-of-building education. They would see it as an opportunity to get away from their teachers making sure they get their schoolwork done, and would treat the time spent out of the school, due to disablement or quarantine, as a kind of break from having to do work.",Counterclaim
 Some people could argue that they understand a class enough not to attend,Counterclaim
"It can be argued that with the growing teenage population, more disrespect is shown in school, thus making students not want to attend certain classes.",Counterclaim
Some would say to trust the honesty of the student,Counterclaim
some may say that taking online classes at home benefits a student because students have less distractions;,Counterclaim
"With this,comes a conflict in the social aspect of learning ",Counterclaim
"Although working from home may inject some distraction into the work period,",Counterclaim
" Now, some may argue that the subset of students previously mentioned is not representative of the majority of students,",Counterclaim
"Although, some might say that attending school from home is an appropriate option. Due to students feeling more safer at home or they have more independence at home ",Counterclaim
Some say that taking online classes or videos conferencing from home is a benefit for students.,Counterclaim
Other say that online classes or videos conferencing explain in good details..,Counterclaim
"There can be many way of benefiting from distance learning, for instance, time management.",Counterclaim
The next benefiting thing from distance learning is having a comfortable setting where the student can do their work.,Counterclaim
"Some people may counter this viewpoint in many ways. For instance, students are better able to learn in their home because they are comfortable.",Counterclaim
Another viewpoint is that students will have fewer distractions at home.,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, many can argue that being alone and not being able to communicate or socialize with others is what actually leads to depression, and for some, their home can be the opposite of a comfortable place.",Counterclaim
Some may believe that online school is better because the people who have a hard time in school by getting bullied won't have that fear anymore.,Counterclaim
Their are some positive things about taking online classes ,Counterclaim
"Some may argue that you could benefit from attending classes from home, like you could learn better by not being around a lot of other students and learn where there's nobody around, or just like being around their families where they're are more relax at. ",Counterclaim
" But others who live at home and do school work all the time he/she will probably never make new friends, see new things, over come challenges,etc.",Counterclaim
"I know I know you might say ""but a lot of kids love socializing that their thing"".",Counterclaim
"However, it is likely that students will take advantage of this feature in a negative way. The lack of commitment to the online learning can decrease their will to learn. They can skip class and not get anything done at home. In addition, there is a lot of room for malfunctions in the technology.",Counterclaim
"Although online schooling programs ultimately offer students an education that fits them, there are some downsides that come with distance learning programs. Distance learning programs rely on the use of technology. Students in these programs have all of their school work online.",Counterclaim
 Another problem students face when learning through technology is the gap between them and the classroom.,Counterclaim
Technology can be expensive,Counterclaim
There is a gap when it comes to technology ,Counterclaim
Others may still say that some students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because its better for the students needs. Some students doesn't even probably are more comfortable being in a public environment anyways so they find it best to stay home. ,Counterclaim
"Even though some may believe that ""students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home""",Counterclaim
Everyone has a reason to be home schooled,Counterclaim
"On the contrary, the online classroom does have some limitations. Firstly, not every student may have access to internet at their home. Other students may have spotty connection at best or limited amount of screen time.",Counterclaim
Some may argue that allowing distance learning could actually harm students. ,Counterclaim
Some others will say that attending classes from home can be a good idea because they can work on in any time,Counterclaim
Some people may say that students won't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they won't get to meet new people and make friends and they won't really experience the real world. ,Counterclaim
Most parents believe actual school is better for students because they might have a better chance in getting higher education and better jobs ,Counterclaim
"But this method of learning is not always the case for some students, because it gives this students an opportunity to become nonchalant about their classes; Consequently, they start to fool around and get distracted at times.",Counterclaim
"Although students could make friends at school and learn real life social skills,",Counterclaim
Parents believe that a student would rather benefit from going to school and doing the work rather than staying at home and doing their classes there.,Counterclaim
"Some might say that online schooling is just another expense to the school,",Counterclaim
Some people think that students are better off taking classes from school ,Counterclaim
Although some may believe otherwise ,Counterclaim
Arguers of this debate would say that distance learning should not be offered to students because it would be easy for a student to become unmotivated if not put in a classroom where ones teacher is continuously monitoring their work ,Counterclaim
"However, allowing a student to take online classes doesn't mean they're able to sit at home doing anything,",Counterclaim
Yet some still believe that school should be a student's only focus ,Counterclaim
"Some say that the sense of being overwhelmed can still occur if one isn't able to keep up with their work, ",Counterclaim
But many students wouldn't like it for many reasons. They believe that doing it at school is better then at home. ,Counterclaim
Some students would think other wise then me and other students that agree with me.,Counterclaim
Some may believe students are better off with distance learning because it eliminates social anxieties and discomfort in the classroom ,Counterclaim
Some people my say that if students have home school it will be good because some students can get bully at school and they do not want to go back. ,Counterclaim
"Some may say, School districts should keep it as a traditional learning because they offer plenty of assistance for the students if they are struggling. Traditional learning has been here for years because it has been successful and is the best way for students to learn information that they will remember even after they graduate.",Counterclaim
"Some people address that attending school physically has many more benefits,",Counterclaim
 Some may say that distance learning is not beneficial to students because the courses offered online are not the ones they need for school. ,Counterclaim
"Some may say that their immune system is healthy; therefore, they wont benefit from distance learning.",Counterclaim
Some may say that they that they can go to school and watch their children.,Counterclaim
Some may say online classes is not such a good idea because some people do not have internet or any technology.,Counterclaim
But if you were to work from home you would be able to cheat on the test or not even focus on it you could be watching TV while doing the test and that isn't the best choice,Counterclaim
Now i'm not 100% sure about staying home and doing class from there would work out because not all students have the same mindset some like being in school because the teacher pushes them to do their work we all need a little push in life also some students can get away with so much from home if they were do a assignment or test you can just easily search up the answers. Some of my friends have done that when their teachers post things on Google classroom they don't usually do it themselves,Counterclaim
"A counterclaim to this would be that since the students are at home, they could get lazy and not do their work, or not even attend their classes.",Counterclaim
Computers can do various things,Counterclaim
"While you can also do that online,",Counterclaim
"Distance learning is good for when a student is sick or out of town,",Counterclaim
 Being in the classroom is extremely well since you can talk with the teacher one on on and can usually always ask for help.,Counterclaim
Although some people say that they won't focus on their school work at home,Counterclaim
For my counter argument I'm saying that they should not allow students to do online school. Doing school at home could be difficult for some students.,Counterclaim
"Those who believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons. They think it's much safer for students to take an online class at home. And they also believe it might be better for students to study under a quite environment.
",Counterclaim
"Although some may say otherwise,",Counterclaim
"Some may say students will not learn anything from online classes,",Counterclaim
"Some people may say students should be focusing on school work first before anything else,",Counterclaim
Some may say students should challenge themselves instead of finding an easy way like taking online classes.,Counterclaim
"In contrast, some students would benefit for taking classes online from home because, students feel safety at home, some students live far away of the school and they do not have transportation. Also, some students have jobs and other responsablities. ",Counterclaim
While there many benefits to virtual classes if utilized properly ,Counterclaim
Also we have people who disagree for the reason that they have to pay for those classes and think they are wasting money for no reason because they have public school that can teach them and not paying nothing so they can graduate and can go to college or the university . ,Counterclaim
The contrary of distance learning can be dismantled in many well opposing minds in school departments due to the explicit and dramatic change to the idea. There are some counter implications that can be mentioned for the sake of improvement.,Counterclaim
"However, there is way more distracting things at home than at school, such as video games, phones, sleeping whenever, etc.",Counterclaim
"However, one of the downsides of online schooling is that there is more distractions at home than at school I believe.",Counterclaim
There are a lot of people in school that wish that they could have that chance to stay home and learn there.,Counterclaim
Your counterargument of having the student tell the teachers about it,Counterclaim
"Critics may argue that by having students attend school from their homes and through online/video conferencing, students will benefit more than if they went into schools.",Counterclaim
Even though you are losing some when doing online school,Counterclaim
"Some like to argue that online school gives students more freedom to explore new topics, ",Counterclaim
"For me if I could choose , I'll choose going to school. Why? because its more better for me to learn from a teacher in person and see what they are do for me to learn. Online its okay , but staying at home make me get lazy and too comfortable by staying home",Counterclaim
It can be argued that students do benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they can learn in a more comfortable setting where they would face less peer pressure.,Counterclaim
The classes provided gives the student the ability to have more flexibility when choosing courses to take in school ,Counterclaim
"Some may say that students and teenagers need a chance to socially interact with others, and school helps provide that.",Counterclaim
"However, students can take advantage of these class course like cheat on tests or take the class and forget to do it or just not do it at all. Distance learning can be some what unorthodox for many students and even the school as a whole.",Counterclaim
"Now negatives of having these options are that individuals may start to abuse it, for instance if somebody is assigned to online schooling they dont have to go anywhere to do it they can stay home,",Counterclaim
Some people say students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students can work at their own pace.,Counterclaim
" However, school isn't for everyone, there is many situations where it might be best for the student to do online classes.",Counterclaim
There are many good thing about taking classes online but there always somethings students would need to give in order to have this benefits ,Counterclaim
"However, this does not mean that school should be strictly online. The option to attend class online benefits many students, but some prefer traditional schooling. Online school would also have to structure itself differently to prevent cheating.",Counterclaim
Some claim that distance learning helps those with mental illness and that attending schools would cause more harm to these students than help them.,Counterclaim
"Going to school helps students make friends. School is the number 1 place where most children and teens make friends and meet people and if they taking the classes online, they dont get the chance to experience that.",Counterclaim
"Traditional classroom learning may be what nearly everyone in the country is used to, ",Counterclaim
"One counter argument that people have is that teachers have a way of seeing how many tabs are opened on the computer,",Counterclaim
"many of students and adults have disagreed and believe that attending classes at home is more beneficial than going to an actual school. Many of adults believe that if students attend classes at home, then it can help and get them ready for the real world, but it can also help them get ready for collage. ",Counterclaim
"If students deside to go school , they can take all the classes that they want to take",Counterclaim
"While I do agree that a home setting would make students feel comfortable,",Counterclaim
"Now you could say that this argument is very situation based,",Counterclaim
"While I do feel that technology has tremendously improved the learning experience for students,",Counterclaim
There are some people that claim that being home schooled can be beneficial ,Counterclaim
"An issue that rises up with that is some classes or lessons wouldnt be able to be taught online like experiments in a science class or a class like Physical education, ",Counterclaim
"Yes, online classes may not work for everyone ",Counterclaim
"Although the use of video conferencing has many benefits for students, many schools and parents fear that the program used to make these conferences can cause glitches",Counterclaim
But not everething it's good about this idea some kids maybe oh actually they gonna stop going to the school and stay in his house and skiping the school.,Counterclaim
Some may argue that learning from home is not beneficial for students because of the lack of supervision and how easy it is for one to get distracted in the comfort of ones own home.,Counterclaim
 Although some people believe that attending classes from home is more beneficial,Counterclaim
"Although online classes are proven to be beneficial to those taking it, there are some people who are against classes being taken online. They claim that it is harder for the student to stay focused, easier to cheat, may be costly, and not taken seriously.",Counterclaim

Those is favor of this would argue that some students feel more comfortable at home and therefore would preform better.,Counterclaim

"Although some people may find distance learning problematic because the students wouldn't able to talk to a teacher face to face, and have them correct something by hand ",Counterclaim
Although this can open many doors for students and their families ,Counterclaim
"Firstly, I want to start with I know most people would say that students won't be able to get help.",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, critics of online learning may say that there are public academies for students who wish to specialize in STEM careers or pursue the humanities and that it is better for students to learn in a formal classroom setting rather than from at home.",Counterclaim
" going to school is the best decision that you can make on your life, you get to make friends and get to know a lot of people during all the time you spend at school,",Counterclaim
This might be a good reson becouse some kids have jobs or family things to do during the day. Sometimes if kids are geting buled in school they can tack there class frome home and not have to deel with other students or if a student get suspended they can still take there class wale they are out of school ,Counterclaim
Being in Generic_school doesn't really help at all ,Counterclaim
"People, parents, like to argue that being in school helps children physically and mentally",Counterclaim
 I like public school because i can make friends I love to have people i can relate to. I feel like if i did online learning i would feel lonely but thats my opinion.,Counterclaim

"Second,the student want to stay home school they should know home school make your lazy because you don't have any activity to do you you stay home all time.",Counterclaim
"However, some may argue that looking at the bright screen for a extended amount of time will put a strain on your eye's. Also that it's easier to cheat on test's and quiz's in online classes then it is to cheat in school, because the teacher dosen't know what your doing on. ",Counterclaim
"and sometime your friends or students from others huose talk to allowed you can't consentrate. Thas one reason, another reason is, maybe you don't have all the time you need, couse some time you need think about the question or something you lost a lot time in that, and sometimes the question come a litter bit hard you need think more to answer that question. Some students are so annoyoing for example they don't listen what the teacher said or they don't paid attention,when my teacher say something we have to do it, because we are in the class for learn somethibg new like world new or something like that, ",Counterclaim
It could be argued that public schools are cheaper and that they can supervise younger children for free while allowing parents to work,Counterclaim
"While it is a good practice for some students who can not attend the class, some would argue it ineffective and that students would not attend them anyways. ",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, there are some downsides to why online schooling wouldn't be beneficial for students ",Counterclaim
"
While some people may think that students wouldn't learn well without face to face lessons from teachers ",Counterclaim
Although these friends can sometimes be a distraction ,Counterclaim
But don't get me wrong there is some people who would rather learn from a teacher and be able to ask live questions. Maybe even find learning from home could be a distraction because of siblings and things of that nature. ,Counterclaim
But with a online teachers and being at home they will be able to contrate better and pay attention. Because they don't have anybody to worry about judging them for there answers or even the cloth they wear on there back.,Counterclaim
If you where in school and would have to do the work the next day after you feel better. ,Counterclaim
Thus someone might ague that online courses does not offer social skills that you develop when you are enrolled in public schools ,Counterclaim
"Some people can not like this idea because some people this not help they , maybe they student no leaening online or whating the videos . ",Counterclaim
Many may argue that students may not be actually attending these classes or may cheat their way through school,Counterclaim
"Although there will be a lot less distractions,",Counterclaim
Working from home can have its benefits like being with family more often. ,Counterclaim
One thing about working at home is you would make your own schedule which could be flexible to your own time. ,Counterclaim
"This does not apply to every student with attention disorders,",Counterclaim
taking classes from home would lessen your social activity and there are just some things that only school can offer. ,Counterclaim
In most colleges though your gonna be in a big classroom withe even more kids so I do think school does get you used to that kinda feel so it isn't all bad with the classroom environment. ,Counterclaim
"However, there is the issue of distraction. Surely a student left to learn at home with no teacher physically present is more likely to be distracted! ",Counterclaim
"On the other hand , some will disagree by saying that if students dont attend actual school they will become lazy and irresponsible ",Counterclaim
On the other hand many will disagree and say that if students stay at home and pursue their education there they will become irresponsible and lazy ,Counterclaim
Here some reasons why student's will take school over online or video conferencing classes. Student's won't be able to play on one of the school's sports team ,Counterclaim
The concept of online classes seems great on the surface ,Counterclaim
"Some students agree they can benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they can do it later, if they miss something on class. Also, they can study anywhere they can have access to it.",Counterclaim
"There are cons to taking classes online, such as less personal relationships with the teacher, and an increased workload. ",Counterclaim
While some might argue that taking extra classes is more of a risk because of the increased workload ,Counterclaim
"Although some of these students may not have access to a computer,",Counterclaim
"
Although distance learning seems like an ideal way to learn, there are several downsides to it. One of which is a less flexible curriculum. Due to lessons being in video form, teachers are unable to tailor lessons to fit the needs of particular students or classes. ",Counterclaim
"In the other hand, if the weather nice outside and students go to school , sit in a classroom, in the afternoon they wll be able to enjoy the weather and get there work done.. ",Counterclaim
Others say the environment in which there in doesn't matter as long as there focued,Counterclaim
"On the contrary, some students have a better time understanding material when they can speak to teachers face to face.",Counterclaim
"Some people may say students can always go back home to visit family, or use the FaceTime app to see them.",Counterclaim

"Some people may argue that, without a teacher, students would not complete their work. Possibly allowing themselves to fail in favor of playing a video game or sleeping.",Counterclaim
"Now, some people may say that because students are at home they can still get distracted from other things around them ",Counterclaim
Yes some people make the argument that its a bad thing because the student isnt with the teacher and can't ask questions. ,Counterclaim
While students need a breaks for school sometimes and online school has the possibility of taking that away ,Counterclaim
"Many people say that kids should not miss school for entertainment purposes, ",Counterclaim
" There are those who say that attending class online is better,",Counterclaim
"Some people may say that distance learing is beneficial to the student becuase it allows them to learn on their on pace at home, ",Counterclaim

People always think that taking an online class is very good ,Counterclaim
"While the concept of at-home education is beneficial for the majority of the time, there is always a negative side ",Counterclaim
Although some view online classes as a source of increased procrastination and growth of anti-social tendencies ,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, some students tend to work better when they are in their own space ",Counterclaim
"Although the risks of distance learning are clear, there are also reasons for this option to be made available. If given the ability to attend classes online, it will be significantly easier for students to make up any missed work, and as a result, students will be less likely to fall behind in class.",Counterclaim
"
However, some say school shouldn't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because students wouldn't get enough knowledge at home, it's better in school.",Counterclaim
The largest downside to distance learning however is the funding for this massive move to virtual classes and learning ,Counterclaim
With students being within walking distance of their personal belongings they could get easily sidetracked or lose focus with another activity. ,Counterclaim
 Another issue with online classes are that there are some classes you can't actually take online ,Counterclaim
Some say that the students need to interact with teachers and students;,Counterclaim
Now the opposite opinion from mine would be to think that this is not beneficial to students at all.,Counterclaim
"
It sounds like a great idea to have it available online ",Counterclaim
"However, while online school is great for some students, theres always one that student who never gets their work done and just plays around. ",Counterclaim
"Also, even though they can watch a live class session it restricts students from being able to ask questions at the moment. ",Counterclaim
",however, taking online classes can get you easily distracted when you're at home or a public place trying to do you work and you hear people talking and having conversations all around you ",Counterclaim
"Although taking classes online and not having to go anywhere and stay where you are is good, you're putting your grades at risk, the computer can malfunction or even be corrupted with a virus on it, and it can slow down your computer or even shut it off every time you need to do your work.",Counterclaim
Although online school might be a good tool for some scholars it can also cause negative outcomes,Counterclaim
"Other issues that must be faced ,are some students not having computers, or not having access to the internet to do their assigned work.",Counterclaim
"Some may argue that online courses should be able to record student progress through test scores and quiz grades,",Counterclaim
"Although it may seem like a blessing to manipulate scheduling and due dates,",Counterclaim
Supporters of online schooling may argue that procrastination is not a valid reason for disapproval in online schooling since both online and physical schooling produce procrastination.,Counterclaim
"This may seem like a gift at first because the student has more time to hang out with friends or study,",Counterclaim
"Although some may believe otherwise,",Counterclaim
"Some may say that distance learning has nothing to do with improving ones social skills, they are mistaken. ",Counterclaim
"Others might also say that getting educated at home has nothing to do with interacting with others, they are incorrect.",Counterclaim
"Many may disagree with this position, saying that this opportunity, to learn in the comfort of ones own home, would greatly benefit those who suffer from illness or other challenges that prevent them from attending school. ",Counterclaim
While most would think having an in school education is more benifital ,Counterclaim
"However, what sets online learning apart form traditional learning is the aspect of the ""comforts of home"" ",Counterclaim
It has been said that many individuals use online learning as a method to work around the high cost of education and/or older studets who ensure busy scedules due to long working shifts ,Counterclaim
"Some may disagree and say that online classes at home are more benefit for students.
",Counterclaim
"Now, there may be parental guidance present who could limit the amount of distractions",Counterclaim
"Now, the student could make up what they missed on another day",Counterclaim
"While attending classes at home holds would not benefit many, it could benefit a few ",Counterclaim
Students may argue that homeschooling would not benefit them ,Counterclaim
"Others may argue that although being able to attend online classes provides a platform that solves transportation needs, it poses the threat of students falling behind due to lack of a physical teacher.",Counterclaim
"
However, most aruge that distance schooling can be harmful to many ",Counterclaim
"With all the good that comes with online school resources however, come many downfalls ",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, some people be leave that schools should not offer distance learning. They be leave this because it limits human interaction and prevents a sense of responsibility from forming. ",Counterclaim
Although distance learning is sometimes regarded as a preferred alternative for many students who may struggle in a traditional K-12 setting,Counterclaim
"While receiving an online education may offer a more comfortable environment for many students,",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, other schools claim that it is a good idea for students to take online classes.",Counterclaim
"One might believe that when students aren't in a classroom environment, they are simply just going to find a way to cheat the system and not actually do the work and tests assigned to them like a famous Youtube creator has told his fans",Counterclaim
"Contrary to what most children in an institution may say,",Counterclaim
Those who believe attending classes online is more beneficial have their reasons. ,Counterclaim
Others might say learning from home is not beneficial because physical human interaction with different teachers and students help a child learn more. ,Counterclaim
"Even though there are many good reasons why online school benefits students, some people think that no one should do online school. Their reasonings are that students will be able to get a better understanding of the content in class and with a teacher. Kids would be able to acess help with a subject that they don't understand faster at school, than out of school. ",Counterclaim
"Although some people make it seem taboo that attending classes online is an option a person would rather take than a tradional school,",Counterclaim
"you no have other person for help your self or your teacher not will there, if you have questions to ask to him or her, if more difficult for you understand for your own self you need some person for show you the process of the classes.",Counterclaim
"but no all is benefit, because if used the computer a lot time have risk for your heath your eyes are can by the first problem if you not have care,",Counterclaim
What is your experience working in team? Which will your response? This is one bad reason for take online class. ,Counterclaim
One of the main arguments against distance learning is the lack of communication that spawns from online conferring ,Counterclaim
 there could be some benefits for attending school from home,Counterclaim
Although some schools offer distance learning by staying at home or taking online classes,Counterclaim
"Though, if you were to dive deeper into this you can notice the cons. What worries me about this is the fact that the internet can fail you",Counterclaim
"Someone who is against the idea of video conferencing might say that: ""It costs to much."" or, ""You can just pay attention in class",Counterclaim
Some parents may argue that taking classes online is not in the best interest for young students as it prevents the growth of social skills ,Counterclaim
The only benefits of taking a online class at home is just to sit on your behind all day do whatever you want all day. ,Counterclaim
But same for public school normally public school starts at 7:30am - 8:30am depends what County your in or what school you go to.,Counterclaim
Some might say that a teacher can just supervise students taking distance learning by using a virtual classroom or by means of a live video feed similar to Facetime or Skype. ,Counterclaim
"Now some will say, people with those conditions need more human contact and all students need to be in a interactive classroom setting. ",Counterclaim
Although some may say you are missing out on the importance of a classroom setting ,Counterclaim
"
It can be said that you do not retain all the information that you learn from a online class, ",Counterclaim
"Some may argue that some households have a work space, ",Counterclaim
" Some of students asking for online class they think ""we can do it, but it is not too easy""",Counterclaim
"I think online school is an optimal alternative. It effectively reduces the stress of being in an unfamiliar environment. However, for some kid, school serves as their only time to socialize ",Counterclaim
"When public school students were largely being prepared to work in factories and mines, maybe this system of bells and rigid schedules made sense,",Counterclaim
Some may claim that independent work is a better option ,Counterclaim
"Although some may make claim that taking a course at home provides for more personal time to complete other necessary tasks, and can learn the same information as those who are attending an actual school,",Counterclaim
"Some may also believe that at home courses aren't as complex and are more flexible,",Counterclaim
"Yes, taking actual classes at school help because you have a teacher there to help you ",Counterclaim
One could argue that students wouldn't benefit from attending classes at home because students need social interaction with each other.,Counterclaim
" In my point of view, the only downside to video conferencing and learning online is the neglect you may feel from your friends and in-school activities. Although distant learning holds the possibility of altering your social life,",Counterclaim
"Maybe there are pros, such as getting more sleep or having a quiet environment",Counterclaim
"While some critics of online schooling may say that access to classes online will allow students to easily skip class and not learn the information being taught,",Counterclaim
"Every young student looks forward to a snow day and sometimes even a sick day if it means they get to skip school,",Counterclaim
Most critics of online schooling argue that students will take advantage of online classes and will use them to skip in school classes,Counterclaim
Although some students lack a healthy domestic environment ,Counterclaim
 Many students enjoy taking traditional in person school classes because they can escape an unhealthy or distracting home environment,Counterclaim
The argument can be made that attending classes from home does not allow students to develop communication and social skills because of the decrease in social interaction. ,Counterclaim
 Some may argue that school is necessary for social interactions. ,Counterclaim
"Some may argue,staying home for school is amazing because they think its going to help them way more in school.",Counterclaim
They would think you'll get to wake up whenever you want to. If your having trouble in a class or you just miss a lesson you can always go back to the video conferencing and re watch it. ,Counterclaim
There are still a few reasons not to do distance learning. There many more opportunities with public and private schools.,Counterclaim
"not everyone would think this is a good benefit for students others would think that is bad for students to take classes at home, because students will not get the chance to be social with other, this will make students not be able to work or talk with others outside in person, because they spent so much time at their houses taking classes by themselves ",Counterclaim
Although a student can live far away from the school that they are supposed to attend and the parent or guardian can not support transportation for their child at the moment,Counterclaim
"Online learning can cause some problems, for example when your at home you intend to get more distracted with your phone,TV, food, and anything else at your home.",Counterclaim
"Some may argue that phones will help students to stay on their task, follow online instructions, communicate with their parents can help attend classes from home will be beneficial.",Counterclaim
"However, in extremely serious situations distance learning is able to be beneficiary for students. ",Counterclaim
"Some may say that online classes can be convenient for a student who has a busy work schedule because they can attend classes on their own time, and won't have to spend most of the hours that are in a day to go to the actual school ",Counterclaim
Taking classes online is a benefit when you know how to manage time,Counterclaim
"However there also some disadvantage of take online classes because sometimes the students don't use this opportunity from the best way .One disadvantage is that some students when they are taking online classes they can uses the phone and those devices distract them so much,",Counterclaim
One more disadvantage is that when the students are taking classes online they attend to loss interest and prefers do other things instead of do their assignments ,Counterclaim
Although some may believe students will benefit better by attending classes from home,Counterclaim
"While human interaction can be achieved through video calls,",Counterclaim
A counter argument could be that some families might be not having a laptop to use for your online courses,Counterclaim
"
Having ease of access to learning the work and working at your own pace may present itself to be a better option then going to school,",Counterclaim
Many people believe that having classes online wouldn't be beneficial for students because they wouldn't have any one on one help with teachers ,Counterclaim
Teachers may argue that distance learning is not an adequate method of education because the student will not be completing their assignments due to the lack of authority ,Counterclaim
While the student could have their parent come around and simulate that teacher presence,Counterclaim
"The online classroom may have some advantages, such as being a way for sick or injured students to keep track of schoolwork ",Counterclaim
"But in the other hand, attending to school directly is better for some students. ",Counterclaim
Some may argue that attending classes from home would not benefit the student. ,Counterclaim
Although not everyone may have internet connection but they can still attend school ,Counterclaim
Having school online may be convienent but students could just skip class easily right? ,Counterclaim
"As a result, schools that offer distance learning can be helpful because it makes these students' lives more efficient and affordable.
",Counterclaim
"
With these points, many often say that if online school was added then it would take away from the classroom experience and interactions ",Counterclaim
I understand why some students would consider taking classes from home maybe they have a personally reason or they can't keep up and rather take their time at home but for that reason you would have to do your best and not get distracted. Being home may help them do better then at school I understand ,Counterclaim
"While many adults would believe that students would simply just decide to skip class and go on with their day,",Counterclaim
It could be argued that disrupting a students daily schedule in this manner could cause more harm than good,Counterclaim
"However, some may say that giving students too much freedom during the day could be a recipe for disaster, and could set some students up to fail the courses they have at school, as well as their online course.",Counterclaim
"As much potential as these sorts of classes might have, some people argue that they're infinitely far less interactive than attending them physically.",Counterclaim
One downside to working at home is that you dont get to see your friends as often or make new ones. ,Counterclaim
"Although some may argue that when a student takes classes online, parents can guide them through their child's lessons.",Counterclaim
"Online school is only a good option if it is hard for you to physically to get there. For example, if you are unwell or have a disability that needs assistance and care then online school is the better option.",Counterclaim
". Taking online classes do have some benefits like, not having to miss a single lesson due to snow ,or having a one on one conference with the teacher, and having to stay home to learn the lessons.",Counterclaim
not friends or groups,Counterclaim
",tools from school that you may need,",Counterclaim
"students can cheat.
",Counterclaim
Like I said there is not benefit too of having classes in online because students doesn't have friends or a group of friends to share their ideas.,Counterclaim
students may need tools from school ,Counterclaim
Other reason why it would not benefit the students is because they can cheat. ,Counterclaim
"Some may say that distance learning would diminish any responsibility students have of making up the hours they missed, saying that this makes it easy for students to miss class ",Counterclaim
"Now, some people will disagree with me and say that we do not need that, people do not want to bring school into their home lives, or that students should go to school anyway ",Counterclaim
sadly others might not support it,Counterclaim
"However, opponents feel that students need to be in a class room to truly grasp and understand the subject at hand. They feel that students do not get the true experience they need, unless in a class room. Opponents believe that students, when in a class room, are exposed to the proper and correct style of teaching needed to get the education for that class. ",Counterclaim
Many people believe that learning at home by a way of online or video conferencing is a great idea to attend classes from home,Counterclaim
"There are students that may disagree and say that they learn fine in a public school environment and dont need distance learning,",Counterclaim
"People may say that not everyone feels that way, but when we have a need to accomplish something, we should feel responsibility and a want to get things done. ",Counterclaim
"However, many students support the idea for students to attend classes from home.",Counterclaim
"Many people might make the argument that online school is cheaper as a whole, ultimately making it a better option ",Counterclaim
"On the other hand, distance learning can be beneficial in some ways ",Counterclaim
"Virtual learning could be helpful in a few cases, such as a student feeling sick or having social anxiety; ",Counterclaim
Some people may say that attending school from home by way of online or video conferencing places less pressure and stress on teenagers.,Counterclaim
Now on the other hand other people might agree with the idea of online school for students. They would say how it would benefit students who have any social anxieties or anything that involves them not being able to go to school.,Counterclaim
Not all teachers do this,Counterclaim
"Some said that take class online will help student's to be more better,",Counterclaim
"Some may argue that it's impossible how she became a lawyer after just doing online school, that its unfair how she got to where she is now because of home schooling, some people may say that by doing online school it can't benefit you nor can it make you a successful person it's just they way to failure.",Counterclaim
"However, some may argue that Generic_Name has to be a man and grow up, he can't always hide from people that are mean to him. That's true he can't always hide from people like that,",Counterclaim
" Some may argue that, They don't see how it benefited her. It have a major change on her, she knew what she wanted to do or be so how did it benefit her. ",Counterclaim
"Some people might say that distance learning is not as beneficial as classroom learning,",Counterclaim
Some might say that there are more distractions at home,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, it is still crucial for students to attend school to develop communication and social skills.",Counterclaim
"Although it may be a easier for students to cheat with distance learning,",Counterclaim
"Some people believe that kids do not benefit from online school, for example, the kids can't get actual help from a teacher who is normally present during regular school. ",Counterclaim
"Students can surely benefit from taking classes from home, they wouldn't be interrupted or distracted by their fellow students ",Counterclaim
Some people think that students shouldn't attend class for home because people say that the kids are not going to do there work and they are going to be playing there video games and not pay attention.,Counterclaim
"Not all students benefit from this way of learning, so it is important that schools offer this as an option not a requirement for students ",Counterclaim
"There are many social benefits to going to school, this is how many people gain friends or learn social skills. Yes this is very important to peoples development,",Counterclaim
however; attending online classes and watching videos save students time,Counterclaim
"Some would say that since they are not required to show up and they know for a fact attendence isnt a problem and being behind in late work is also not an issue, this can also encourage more students to not want to actually attend school.",Counterclaim
Some may say that students who take online classes from home will not improve academically due to the absence of the physical presence of a teacher ,Counterclaim
Some may argue that online classes from home have no real health benefits.,Counterclaim
 Some may say that classes from home decreases the ability of students to be able to cooperate among each other.,Counterclaim
School online may help others then going to actual school.,Counterclaim
On the other note it's good for schools to do that. ,Counterclaim
Some people may say that allowing students to take school online would be a negative thing because it puts too much responsibility on the students and would make it hard to do extracurricular activities. ,Counterclaim
Some may argue that doing school online can hurt you in the long run,Counterclaim
"Some parents or students may disagree with the thought of Online school, because some would say ""Kids need to be social"" or ""They need to get out more"",",Counterclaim
"One concern schools might have is if they give this option of attending school online, would none of the students actually be physically present in school ",Counterclaim
Many parents and adults will argue that students will not get as much work done at home because there are too many distractions and there is not a teacher that can help them. ,Counterclaim

Although the technology that is at the school board's disposal is useful ,Counterclaim

",Counterclaim
Distance learning has some flaws to because sometimes it might not always work there could be bugs in the software or the quality of the video might not be great,Counterclaim
Some people might think distance learning is a waste of time because students who dont pay attention in school wont pay attention if there in distance learning.,Counterclaim
"Lastly, some argue that malfunctions can occur with the technonlogy and that students could have unexpected problems with internet connection,",Counterclaim
people may want to go to school from home ,Counterclaim
Some schools affter classes from home because they think is good option to students. Also students can stay more relaxing from home. Students have more time to do homework. Also they feel more comfortable at home. Also they feel safe at home with their family. Also student sleep more and stay with more energy to receive the class by online.,Counterclaim
 Even though creating programs like this could be very expensive and teachers may have to work extra time ,Counterclaim
"but classes online would benefit me because, I need help understanding classes like geometry or English is not easy for me to understand some words in English, and I need to ask a lot of questions. ",Counterclaim
"Some people think that students who take classes online don't make the same effort like those who take classes in school , because they don't wake up in the morning to take the school bus like normal high school students do  ",Counterclaim

On the other hand some students are responsible. They know what have to get done and they get it done with or without any one telling them what to do or reminding them. ,Counterclaim
Those who believe that distance learning would not benefit students have their reasons. ,Counterclaim
"Some people may think that distance learning would be beneficial to students,",Counterclaim
Some individuals believe that learning from home would allow students to work at their own pace. Some even say it results in less anxiety.,Counterclaim
"The only possible upsides of allowing students the choice of online school would be the safety and accessibility benefit, if schools were to allow students to learn online, they would be safe from physical dangers like bullying or mass shootings.",Counterclaim
"Specialization could also come with the choice of online school. Currently, students are put into schools based on their living location. This causes a large rift in the performance of schools, even in the same district.",Counterclaim

People may say that school online doesn't affect friendships. ,Counterclaim
Many people believe that allowing students to work from home would be beneficial because they would not have to wake up at a certain time to get ready.,Counterclaim
By the way online and video conferencing the student must be have internet access at home ,Counterclaim

Some people might say that you are running away from a problem,Counterclaim

"However, even though there is much evidence to backup why going to a classroom to learn is better, it can be stated that learning online through video calls is the way to go. If students have anxiety or are constantly stressed out, learning online may be a much more relaxing way to gain material. ",Counterclaim
"At first glance, it seemed like her plan was working since everyone in the class got very good scores on said assignment.",Counterclaim
"I do feel like it would be hard on the teachers though having to deal with the class, and setting up the things that the online students need as well. ",Counterclaim
but you have to realize school is one of the few places when people are young get to really get out and socialize with other young people instead of being cooped up in a house all day with nothing to do.,Counterclaim
"While in-building schooling fails to do this by turning school, and by extension, learning, into a chore and cracking down on spoon-feeding students information which they spit back out and are then evaluated on, ",Counterclaim
There are still people who believe that online school cannot compare to traditional learning. Face to face education may seem to have an advantage over learning through a screen.,Counterclaim

Some might say that public school is a better option for education ,Counterclaim
"However, choosing to attend online school will not guarantee a distraction free zone, instead it will just allow students to work in an area of their choosing and at their own pace. By letting online students work at their own pace, it could cause them to fall behind in their work each week if they choose to not participate in their daily lessons. ",Counterclaim
 Some may argue that if we can notify the student that a lecture is starting so they can be ready for their lesson or test. ,Counterclaim
Some may argue that they could email to confirm the message from the parent. ,Counterclaim
Some may argue that the schools can lend them their own laptops to help them out with their classwork and insert ability to the online classes.,Counterclaim
Several students and teachers may argue that online schooling is more beneficial for students. ,Counterclaim

Although there are downsides to learning from home. While the students are home the opportunity to cheat is much higher since at home there are no teachers constantly monitoring the students work and progress ,Counterclaim
Schooling from home also causes the students to miss out on social interaction and the student is less likely to develop friendships and relationships. ,Counterclaim
 because even though it may seem easier and more fun,Counterclaim
"On the other hand distance learning can be used in a wrong way, where students simply don't care about their classes, this shows that is not a perfect system that needs to be used only when is necessary to put on practice.
",Counterclaim
Some people may disagree and say online classes allow students to become off task. ,Counterclaim
" There are people that would differ about the benefits of distance learning, like how can aren't learning to work with others and how isolating a child to only learn at home mean they're going to follow through with there work ",Counterclaim
"Some may argue that the convenience would lead to a lack of physical interactions at a school, isolating students from developing relationships with their peers ",Counterclaim
Some may argue that online learning does not allow for students to get specialized or individual help if they have issues ,Counterclaim
"But some opponents believe students will inevitably take advantage of being online, where they are prone to the temptations of plagarism and where they can find the answer key to every worksheet they've ever been handed.",Counterclaim
Some opponents say a it is inevitable for a students social life to diminish when they do not have face-to-face contact with their teachers or peers.,Counterclaim
"Although, others might be reluctant to this idea and say that students are better off working entirely from school, or that school work should stay at school ",Counterclaim
"Critics might point out that in a video conference, they can see others face to face.",Counterclaim
"Alternatively, these students would have much less social interaction than those who take their classes at the school, a factor that repels many from online courses.",Counterclaim
"However, some may argue that taking away the typical school atmosphere would be hard for some, as there is little to no social interaction in these online courses and the feeling of working alone at home rather than with classmates may be difficult.",Counterclaim
"Although there are numerous benefits to learning digitally, some people are still doubting online education, One prominent reason why some people would still have some doubts, would be that not learning in a regular school environment isn't quite as beneficial or effective in contrast to the average student learning in the school area itself. ",Counterclaim
"Although students believe that learning at home benefits their learning style,",Counterclaim
"While others believe that students benefit from learning at home, ",Counterclaim
Others might say that having classes from home is better because they will do to their best and they will take their time,Counterclaim
Others may argue that some students could be responsible enough to complete their assignments on time ,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, working alone in the comfort of ones own home does avoid distractions from other students and events;",Counterclaim
Staying home and doing online classes is fun because we are able to stay in our night clothes and do school work.,Counterclaim
Some parents may argue that distance learning will cause students to become lazy and socially awkward ,Counterclaim
"Some students may work well in a quiet environment such as a library or a home,",Counterclaim
"If this system is implemented, there is a chance it will be abused, and punishments will have to me made with the goal of preventing abuse,",Counterclaim
We all know there is good and bad that come from online courses. These are some reasons why people think there is no good coming from it.,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, many individuals frown upon the influx of online classes. The public believes that many people have used online and video conference classes as a slacking tool. Media tries to persuade the Public, not to apply for online classes and video conferences believing that they are a waste of time, proving that that they will not challenge you.",Counterclaim
"Some may say that through the distance learning program, students are able to skip class with no consequence.",Counterclaim
 People also argue that students are distracted easily and are not able to retain information as well as in a classical learning setting; however this is not true. ,Counterclaim
However not everyone agrees that atteneding to school is benificial for students. some students think that having to show up to school is a waste of time and that it would be better if they learn by looking tutorials on youtube or being able to attend classes from home.,Counterclaim
 Students also don't agree about having good grades and a good GPA. For example students think that they can still go to the collages they want to attened without matter of there grades and GPA that all they had to do is pay.,Counterclaim
Now for the cons. homeschooling doesn't give the child an actual high school experience in a way they don't have access to an teacher at that second or whenever they're stuck on an problem. ,Counterclaim
it's almost kinda like i'm torn in between because I like going to school also and seeing the different people that I go to school with instead of being at home in front of an laptop or computer screen everyday I have classes.,Counterclaim
But I know you're asking yourself but what if the student does't have access to such thing like an laptop or computer the school should issue out laptop and other things to the kids that need them ,Counterclaim
"However, some argue that online classes are beneficial for students. Many people believe that having online classes helps by eliminating causes of spreading sickness, bullying, and even being late to school ",Counterclaim
Although one can argue that online classes benefit students with physical disabilities,Counterclaim
One can argue that online classes benefit those who have difficulty walking or traveling to school.,Counterclaim
"While some might say that school is not required for the development of young adults into socially able adults, ",Counterclaim
Some may claim that it is possible to create a viable learning environment at home,Counterclaim
"Some may claim the opposite, saying that it is important to rely on the integrity of students to give them a sense of trust and independence. ",Counterclaim
Often people think that students would benefit from attending classes from school only because they can receive a hands on learning experience ,Counterclaim
"Online classes can often help people but make it harder for other people to learn, ",Counterclaim
Kids who display anti-social tendencies or simply wish to stay home and away from the hustle-and-bustle of the outside world would prefer distance learning undoubtedly.,Counterclaim
"However, some people will raise the point that there are distractions within in the classroom and students will slack off anyway, if they so desire ",Counterclaim
"It's easily understandable that for some students, distance learning is simply the only viable option. Whether they physically cannot make it to the school building, or because their school merely doesn't offer the classes they wish to take, sometimes students are more or less forced to take online classes. And this is completely acceptable and understandable, and no one should fault these students for desiring an education and seeking out alternative options ",Counterclaim
"Others may disagree and claim that the online schooling resources, such as skype, will provide students with the social interaction they need outside of their own families. ",Counterclaim
Some have argued: going to school can help students develop social skills. They could establish everlasting friendships and learn some life lessons from said friends. You can't learn all of this from behind a screen.,Counterclaim
"Unfortunately many might disagree, giving forth the thought that teenagers dont pay attention or even attend school in the first place why should the option to let them stay home be offered.
",Counterclaim
On the other hand kid might take advantage of this and skip school put the lessons on then go out and do stuff. They may also just get lazy and relay on the lessons to do work. ,Counterclaim
"However, many argue that the student would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, for distance learning would encourage laziness and create a communication barrier between students and others ",Counterclaim
Many also point to a communication barrier between the students and their peers and teacher.,Counterclaim
the people can say you cant take the class online because you work for ten hours for this ,Counterclaim
"in the end you cant take the class because is more difficult for learn in your work. is more better take the class in the school you have more benefit how you can pass the class and more oportunities that the school have for you ,and in the school you can help new students ,and in the school you can protrude like better student in the school.",Counterclaim
Currently the world is becoming more technologically advanced and most careers have adapted this new wave of advancements. It can be said that the computer focused aspect of distance learning will better prepare students for jobs such as these.,Counterclaim
 Some may argue that students have the ability to do these activities on their own time if they desire to do so. ,Counterclaim
Distance learning is a very wonderful concept when it comes to how we teach children. It allows student to be more comfortable and work by their own schedule for the most part. The fact that technology has become such a common aspect of life that children are able to be taught in this way is an achievement in itself.,Counterclaim
"Some people on the side of distance learning would argue that having relationships like that are monogamist and not a necessary need,",Counterclaim
 Online classes have a positive side to them because there is many options online in what you want to learn about,Counterclaim
Many people believe that online school gives students more time for other outside of school activities. ,Counterclaim
"However, not everyone agree with this statement that some people believe students would benefit from being ale to attend classes from home because students can work and learn with their own way, have classes that they very want to learn, and help them to work in the computer.",Counterclaim

"Thirdly, teachers may say that a student would not learn as well when they are left on there own to study and do there work,",Counterclaim
Not all people with disabilities have trouble in a classroom. ,Counterclaim
Perhaps the largest issue raised regarding distance learning is time management. ,Counterclaim
"Critics may argue that online schooling has a positive impact on students because if they learn in an enviorment that they feel most comfortable in, then they will be able to absorb more information on a daily basis. They may also say that it is more managable for busy students, and that they can work their schedules around education.",Counterclaim
"Although, I agree with homeschooling; Some, could say homeschooling is not beneficial. Homeschooling can cause mental health problems like social anxiety and depression.",Counterclaim
Eventhough students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home there is some students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they might not take it serious.,Counterclaim
"Many older generations disagree with online education, they believe that if a student has too much freedom, they will soon become rebellious and not work on their schoolwork",Counterclaim
some believe that taking virtual classes is easier and more flexible for a busy student.,Counterclaim
"Although a student should rest and recover when they're sick, ",Counterclaim
I understand that online learning might not be beneficial for all students since each student has their own way of learning and that some students might not have the technology for it at home; ,Counterclaim
"Although many students would not like online learning,",Counterclaim
"There is an argument that, in some cases, this could be negating some of the things that public school taught students, being present as much as possible along with just simply not being what some students are able to handle.",Counterclaim
"Some people think that this a way to lose the time,",Counterclaim
Though some people believe that allowing kids to stay home and do school work is not a great way to handle problems as they may become lazy and not do their work.,Counterclaim
. Online learning may not work for everybody though.,Counterclaim
While other students may not always have access to the internet or power. ,Counterclaim
"However, students that take online classes would be able to learn as they receive direct feedback from the instructor by video chatting or sending messages in regards to a certain assignment the student was confused about",Counterclaim
Although many may argue that classes from home are in fact beneficial as they lead to lack of social anxiety. ,Counterclaim
"Some may argue that you can make a best friend with the people you go to church with, ",Counterclaim
"Some may argue that, getting instruction by teachers is a waste of time,",Counterclaim
Some may argue that you would dont need to manage your time because it won't effect your school life ,Counterclaim
"There may be some consequences, though, when a student works from home, it can be easy for them to slack off without a teacher to remind them when due-dates are. ",Counterclaim
"However, not all students will benefit from online classes.",Counterclaim
Although some may argue against this by saying that if students don't have access to computers at home how would this work. ,Counterclaim
Many people say that the preexisting way school is taught is adequate and should not be changed ,Counterclaim
Some say that attending school from home can benefit students by allowing them to still attend school while out sick. ,Counterclaim
A con of taking online classes at home can be slacking off ,Counterclaim
There are many reasons why online school could be a bad thing. ,Counterclaim
"While technology can be practical at times,",Counterclaim
Critics argue that online school takes away from the personal experience of school and offers a way for kids to not go to school.,Counterclaim
Critics say online school kids use online school as a way to get out of going to real school.,Counterclaim
Some people may argue that the cost is lowered by online schooling at home.,Counterclaim

Others might say that classes online is good because they like to work lonely. The school distract people from their houses ,Counterclaim
"Others may disagree with the idea that students attending class from home is beneficial. Some may argue that a student is not getting all the information needed for their class since they are not actually in the classroom. At home, a student may be more distracted than he or she would be in a classroom. Due to the fact that there is more technology and freedom at home, a student can quickly get off task. Learning from home could also cause students to lose interaction with their classmates and teachers. ",Counterclaim
"Taking classes from home could encourage independence in students,",Counterclaim
"There are some people that could advocate that being in a school environment helps to push a student out of their comfort zone, and to try harder. ",Counterclaim
"The main point made by the opposition is that learning from home is not as stressful as getting up, getting dressed, and going to school on time. These exact tasks teach students how to be timely and responsible. These two skills will be needed in order to maintain a job as an adult and even when their still in school.",Counterclaim
Many people say that students who don't have access to internet would be at a disadvantage.,Counterclaim
"Yes people can teach themselves through practicing and reading on a specific subject, ",Counterclaim
"Although distance learning has many benefits, a con to this issue may be that students procrastinate and feel that they want to relax more if they are at home. When students are at home they feel comfortable and they feel that they have all the time in the world to work from home so they do other activities instead of schoolwork.",Counterclaim
"What good about home School that you can stay at Home, eat your lunch watch T.V, and you will still have time to do your assignment on time. ",Counterclaim
"As for the schools that do partake in online classes from home, I am sure that the students are still able to benefit in some way ",Counterclaim
"Although, some may say that students need a teacher for guidance",Counterclaim
The school can offer alot of helpful classes from students not being there,Counterclaim
"Many students dislike school because of the unnecessary and excessive stress they say it creates,",Counterclaim
Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing because for some students that's the best way to take their classes but for other student is not the best way because some student have to work after school and they have other responsabilities to do,Counterclaim
calsses by way online that's great for some student ,Counterclaim
" Now some may argue and disagree that students would not benefit from taking online classes due to most teens and adults are lazy and would never complete their work or assignments,",Counterclaim
"Furthermore, other people may argue that learning at school is better than learning at home because it allows students to be more socially active.",Counterclaim
"While some may argue that virtual school offers the ability for students to learn from the comfort of their homes, as well as offer opportunities for home-bound students to receive an education",Counterclaim

"Allthrough, attend school at home got some issues too, when you attend school at home you don't socialize, you don't get to know a lot people",Counterclaim
if the take the class online they can read the direction ,Counterclaim
It would be a lie to say that online learning does not have its benefits: it can cater to the needs of students who don't have the means or time to go to class full-time.,Counterclaim
"Others could say that since my class isn't completely online, I benefit more than if it was completely online.",Counterclaim
There are many people who do not agree with the idea of online schooling.,Counterclaim
" Although, there could also be a downfall to this considering the fact that some kids could hold assignments off until the last minute and eventually fall behind, ",Counterclaim
Some people will argue that online school will be easier and the student will not be completing the same tasks as the students in the classroom.,Counterclaim
"But what about if students have any question; how are they going to ask to their teacher?
",Counterclaim
"Adults, parents, and even grandparents all have different points of view when it comes to school for thier kids. Some say that a public education helps kids,teens, and even young adults open their eyes at a young age ",Counterclaim
"Students also start to learn to respect not only thmenselves but adults, those around them, and school property.",Counterclaim
" It is understandable for the parents who want thier kids to attend public schools, it gives them freedom, they get the chance to experience new things and meet new people. ",Counterclaim
"But that is not true, how a student talks and acts around their siblings may not be the same way they should talk and act around a class mate or someone in public. Public education could help them with that. ",Counterclaim
"Some people may say that home schooling is better due to the large cases of bullying, but that problem can always be solved, by reporting to your office or to your teacher. ",Counterclaim

"For example, even if it is helpful to be taught by a teacher in-person,",Counterclaim
Although some schools said students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students need more time to sleep. ,Counterclaim
At this time some schools offer a distance learning program that will let students attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students can eat more deathly food.,Counterclaim
"Some may argue that student may become isolated if they take classes at home. Those that argue that claim may also think that student who take classes at home may lack communication skills, which are essential for the future.

There may be people who disagree,Counterclaim
First :But is better they go to the school,Counterclaim
"Online school while in the end might be more fluid and simplistic than the current method of schooling,",Counterclaim
"while it may be beneficial to students with physical limitation or who need one-on-one assistance,",Counterclaim
Students may need guiedece or may help with a problem they might not know. There are students that have time struggling with a problem and without a teacher around they might not be able to solve it. Without an adults supervision students might copy another person work and this will lead to plagerisim ,Counterclaim
Some time the school benefit the student have class online because the teacher not more to be stay after school or maybe de programs help more the student is like more intereste when riceved class online or maybe they concentration more,Counterclaim

"Many people may argue that online school could be too lenient for students and will not emphasize deadlines, can teach kids the same social skills that being in an actual school would, or that online school doesnt place as many responsibilities on students as normal schools. ",Counterclaim
"Many people may say that there is no better place than home, ",Counterclaim
"One major difference between regular school and home school is the pace at which student work at; home schooling does have the advantage at which students can work at their own pace, which leads to understanding the content at a better rate.",Counterclaim
"But there are also some consequences in Online Classes; online classes, are actually classes and real professors grade you on your work, so if your slacking or getting real low quiz and test scores, you've failed the class, and you don't get any credit from that class. Then you have to redo the whole course, because with no credit you can not graduate. Another reason Online classes have negative results, is that they have the rights to kick you out the class, in the beginning of the course, they're suppose to give you an agreement and term contract, and if your attendance is poor, they'll kick you out the class.

Online classes is not bad because it helps students be more comfortable at home rather than at a school. Most students don't attend college because of the distance. Mostly because they dont know anybody and so they rather be in an environment where they know people. ,Counterclaim
Taking online classes will have some guidance ,Counterclaim
In certain situations; One might take online courses because their income cannot support them ,Counterclaim

"While some will say distant learning has its advantages, others will be quick to point out the disadvantages as well.",Counterclaim
"While there are more reasons why online classes do not work as well as regular ones, the greatest reason distant learning would not benefit students is the potential distractions students may face while doing it. ",Counterclaim
"Meanwhile, giving students the ability to do things from home would be great ",Counterclaim

"Although I think that distance learning could work in a perfect world,",Counterclaim
However some people still disagree due to recent events like corona ,Counterclaim
"if students didn't have to go to school, they wouldn't have to deal with bullies, social anxiety, or small tall,",Counterclaim
"Many students who would be taking at-home-classes would be taking them because of its ease of access, but it doesn't seem very easy to access the chemical needed for a chemistry experiment.",Counterclaim
I agree some students think they would benefits from being able to attend classes from home. ,Counterclaim
While there are certainly students that can handle taking online school ,Counterclaim
 Some people could argue that this holds the threat of exposing distractions to students.,Counterclaim
" Many people argue that students can abuse this opportunity as to skip learning altogether, and allow them to grow bad habits. ",Counterclaim
The largest flaw that has been located is this: some students benefit more from learning in person rather than online.,Counterclaim

what if they don't have a computer at home for to be able to use it for the online class.,Counterclaim
Some parents will not agree I think because they will be working and they don't know with who they can leave their kids with.,Counterclaim
Some may say that you don't get that real teacher student relationship online,Counterclaim
People might think that just asking one person could get it done and over with faster.,Counterclaim
But sometimes I only make it harder on myself by getting answers that are all over the place! ,Counterclaim
yes if you have something small then its still wise to find answers from many people ,Counterclaim
"However, asking for advice to your closest friends might or always be the case. Some people have the idea in mind that since they are your best friend they will say what you want them to say. But it does not always go like that,",Counterclaim
 some people think that they would rather keep everything to themselves and not ask any questions. They might not want to talk about it or they are already good with it and dont need advice. ,Counterclaim
"sometimes you may not want to ask several people for advice on a problem you may have, and it's perfectly fine if you don't want to do something like that.",Counterclaim
"many people say that seeking multiple opinions can confuse the person who is asking, and will result in more problems. ",Counterclaim
Asking multiple people for their opinion can be challenging because the people you ask may not all have the same opinion.,Counterclaim

"Sometimes, people that care too much about you to let you know that you may have been in the wrong give you the advice that you want to hear instead of their take on it.",Counterclaim
"I don't like about talking to a couple of people for advice, is hearing their opinions and advice it could possibly change your mind of you were thinking about before ",Counterclaim
Facts can beat opinions but you can not change what someone believes in if they really do believe in it. ,Counterclaim

"Roman philosopher Cicero said ""no one can give you wiser advice than yourself"",

"However, opinion varies and can not be counted on like education and experience can be. The mindsets and preference of others change the advice they give. ",Counterclaim
Thought advice is good to ask for make sure you ask the right people for advice because some people might not have good advice and miss inform you about something and then someone might ask you about it and then you would spread miss information without even knowing it which leads to that person you just miss informed without knowing to spread what they just learned,Counterclaim
"while many people ask for advice from other people to make the best decision, many other people would rather not ask for any advice at all. ",Counterclaim

There is also a downside to receiving multiple opinions to better your choice.,Counterclaim
" Although, just because a choice has more votes make sure you agree because it's possible for the choices to not all be the best ones.",Counterclaim
"Although not all advice is the best advice,",Counterclaim
While many people are giving advice sometimes the advice that they give has the wrong influence ,Counterclaim
However trying to get advice from multiple sources can be very lengthy and take days or weeks and could just lead to having nothing but biased opinions. Sometimes gathering information can take a very long time and could lead to useless results that cant be used. Your family and friends might also be too busy to help you with anything even if you really needed it.,Counterclaim
However there is an disadvantage in that if the people you ask come to different conclusions then it can cause you more confusion. ,Counterclaim
however this might also confuse people as the advice could either blend in or sound not good at all. sometimes speaking to only one person is better,Counterclaim
"you can however just solve the problem by yourself as other peoples advice might not work out for you. you have to remember that going around asking people for advice might not always be the best solution.
",Counterclaim
for some people however they don't have this option,Counterclaim
asking others for advice might also be a bit annoying.,Counterclaim
"Although people sharing ideas from different perspectives can sometimes lead to disputes and arguments,",Counterclaim
"Unfortunately, asking for other's opinions can also have some downside effects",Counterclaim
A reason someone might not ask for advice might not want to get advice beacuse they might think it will make them look weak for asking for advice. A second reason someone might not ask for advice might be beacuse their nervous to ask. A third reason might be because they might won't have that much people they can ask for advice. ,Counterclaim
"However, many others would rather take their own advice. Some feel like everybody else opinion do not matter.",Counterclaim
Sometimes it might be hard to ask someone for advice or maybe you are too scare of what people might think if you ask for help.,Counterclaim
Although one might not get the response they want ,Counterclaim
"However, some people feel that taking the advice from others is useless. They feel that solving their own problems helps them become a stronger individual.",Counterclaim
"However, some people say that being in a group might intimidate you, and you would be less likely to speak up about your issues, and this argument is valid.",Counterclaim
 Not every ones response is the right choice for you because it cold be good when you hear it but when it happens its all over for you.,Counterclaim
This doesn't always work because you can spend you whole life building up background information to do something you'll never do it because you are to busy asking people.,Counterclaim
You could also think of it the other way. You could say that multiple opinions are bad because people are telling you different things and they all tell you something different and that if you talked to one person that it would be better because you would get their opinion and only their opinion. ,Counterclaim
It's sometimes difficult to agree with some opinions,Counterclaim
 but sometimes asking too many people can be more stressful to you,Counterclaim
"You might not agree with all of them, and that is a part of the process",Counterclaim
going to one more person for advice is not good all the times. ,Counterclaim
I know that it is sometimes hard to ask for advice,Counterclaim
getting opinions from more than one person can get confusing ,Counterclaim
"I have been told, asking for advice is ""embarrassing"" to some people. ",Counterclaim
They could give you bad advice and will effect you,Counterclaim
"On the other hand, many people think that advice isn't good. When asking others for help, they may argue that their opinion is best ",Counterclaim
"Though only asking one person can lead to bad advice, there are times when the advice given is good. This is especially true if you ask someone you can trust.",Counterclaim
"However, not everybody has something noteworthy to state.",Counterclaim
can lead to potential tougher decision making. ,Counterclaim
downside may be tougher decision making,Counterclaim
Though some people feel that asking three or more people can make decision making very difficult.,Counterclaim
"However, asking for advice from others can make it harder to choose, some people believe that some choices can end frienddhips, and sometimes advice from people who have gone through the same situation can give terrible advice and can lead to you making a bad descion and you regretting your descion.",Counterclaim
"There can be many different options and sometimes it can be overwhelming, ",Counterclaim
"When people are getting someone else's a opinion they are making themselves vulnerable to the fact that different possibilities could happen. People can get strongly judged or rejected on their opinions they've made, as that could heavily impact a choice. ",Counterclaim
"when you ask only one person you only receive one point of view and much less information overall, which in the end may be faster but it is less helpful when you need advice.",Counterclaim
"While you might argue, ""How does asking for opinions help people with social interaction?"",",Counterclaim
" On the contrary, some people think seeking multiple opinions cannot help someone make better choices, because some people can give you bad advice and can get you into big trouble.",Counterclaim
if you got bad advice it might effect your whole life,Counterclaim
Sometimes you don't wanna ask people for their advice or maybe you wanna make the decisions yourself. ,Counterclaim
"Many say that you should ""follow your gut,""",Counterclaim
For all they know the person they are asking might not even be as smart as the person asking,Counterclaim
But sometimes listening to other's advice could do us more harm than good.,Counterclaim
Many people think getting other thoughts is not helpful. Multiple opinions just make you over think your decision.,Counterclaim
having multiple people opinions could sometimes be bad.,Counterclaim
it can be bad to ask advice.,Counterclaim
" i understand sometimes you don't want to share your stuff with people so you just have one friend you tell everything to and they help with everything they listen,give back what they think. An yea you might have a different thought of if this like you might think just telling one perosn is better because you don't feel like sharing your stuff with people and i get that",Counterclaim
I know a lot of people dont like when others asking for their opinions,Counterclaim
People say to keep things to yourself and I mean they're right because who wants everyone all up on their business ,Counterclaim
"We don't always need a multiple opinions and advice,",Counterclaim
you do not always have to listen to your friends advice cause they can always be wrong and they might want you to do something bad and make you fall in a wrong path.,Counterclaim
 i recommend you to keep it to your self and not let others give through your head because it might lead you to a bad path because some people want to others get hurt and not do so good while they are doing their best to get out of trouble,Counterclaim
 but it may also make it more difficult to decide with several different opinions. ,Counterclaim
"For some people, with so many opinions, it may become more difficult to decide which choice to make. When you have have several peoples opinions, it may become harder to decide whos opinion to follow or who is truly right. After all, with so many opinions and thoughts it crowds your mind and you do not know which is wrong, and which is right. ",Counterclaim
Some people think that more than one opinion can be confusing or make people over think,Counterclaim
I know a lot of people out there don't like to seek advice from anyone because they are scared that nobody will listen to them or that someone will make fun of them.,Counterclaim
"When listening to other peoples opinion there maybe things you don't agree with, ",Counterclaim
many people just go to one person for advice; someone they trust will give them good advice,Counterclaim
" While this may be true, not everyone is poised to help others in their time of need. ",Counterclaim
"We usually look for multiple answers because when you can't decide on something, you would go to your friends or peers to help you. Gathering the information that they all give you could help but not always. ",Counterclaim
"Now what if you were in a different situation, like you don't know what you should do if there is a virus outbreak in your state. You would most likely go to many websites to see what you should do ",Counterclaim
But some people say that asking strangers for advice is not a good idea because they will either give them bad advice or your talking to someone that is clueless on advice and you should trust only your self. ,Counterclaim
It could also come as a bad think.,Counterclaim
Some people may say that seeking more than one persons opinion is not good. They would say that it takes to long to decide which is best. They like getting the answer and being able to just roll with it and get it done and over with,Counterclaim
"However, I understand how others may not care, or don't give the right advice at times and make every experience you have about to them. That has happened to me many times.",Counterclaim
but also if you get the wrong advice it can cause the wrong thing to occur and a bad idea for the future,Counterclaim
Some could say that it's not helpful because its your own decision and only you can make it ,Counterclaim
"However, some people think that they can figure it out on their own. Some people think they do not need help they might think it is the best choice while others think it is not so good of a choice. ",Counterclaim
Some people might say that it will be hard to find someone who is in the same shoes as you.,Counterclaim
I hear people say that you know whats best for your body and that might be true,Counterclaim
 not all advice is good advice.,Counterclaim
"However, seeking multiple opinions could make things harder when making a choice. ",Counterclaim
you could say that the person that knows you best is you so you should make you decisions. ,Counterclaim
"Now, you might be thinking to yourself, ""She's crazy, I only need one persons advice"".",Counterclaim
"But other people when they have a problem only ask one person they trust the most and don't ask more people because they are shy or, don't want to talk to other people about their problems. ",Counterclaim
Some people have negative opinions and might comment on anything you say. Or they might give you negative opinions themselves ,Counterclaim
Not alot of people will have good advice for what you're looking for,Counterclaim
"Yeah you may say ""more opinions will make you confused about which advice to pick therefore leaving you with another problem to solve"" ",Counterclaim
"However, some people feel that it is better to just ask one person.",Counterclaim
But still the gut feeling is not all bad,Counterclaim
"But beware, some people can give false advice that will make the situation worse or not give you advice at all",Counterclaim
Okay when you talk to one person then it could be helpful to take advice from them.,Counterclaim
Asking one person you trust for advice is something people do more often than asking multiple people. ,Counterclaim
The good thing about asking one person is you don't have to really worry about them going around telling that much people about your problem,Counterclaim
Some people will disagree with my three reasons,Counterclaim
"Now, I know what you probably saying ""But what if everyone you ask gives you incorrect advice?"" ",Counterclaim
